                </h2>
				Aug 31, 2014
                
				
					<p>There's a good set of stories in the family about the First World War courtesy of my great-grandfather Reginald. The idea of him as a proto-Flashheart is doubtless exaggerated (that said when he met&nbsp;his wife &quot;she was 18 and he was 24 and had been engaged twice before&quot;) - but according to the legend he not only discovered&nbsp;a German spy disguised as an army padre by noticing&nbsp;he was wearing the wrong number of pips, but rode a motorcycle through the trenches to save a friend’s girl from a nunnery threatened by the German advance. That one has it all really - solid story. Less on message, he caught typhoid fever - but recovered and survived the war.</p>
<p>His brother left a very different set of stories. Harry Parsons died in an air raid in 1917 - an unlikely way to go, only around 1,500 died because of raids in the entire war. There’s a story passed down that he died wandering into the street to get a better look at the Zeppelins, as it happens there are accounts of people in London doing exactly this:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Raids hadn't become a very serious thing and everybody crowded out into the street to watch. They didn't take cover or dodge.&quot; Lt Charles Chabot, 39 Squadron RFC.</blockquote>
<p>But Harry wasn't one of them. As newspaper archives were opened up my dad found what had been published at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
Henry Over Parsons, 33, violinist [...] According to Superintendent Woolger, a fire brigade officer, the back part of the house was demolished and the whole house of 18 rooms more or less damaged by the explosion. A section of Royal Engineers found the body. The bed appeared to have been turned right over and twisted into a most fantastic shape. Deceased was thrown from the bed.</blockquote>
<p>The story about wandering into the street is interesting, the report of this inquest is attached in the several places it was syndicated with another where the coroner did mark people going to look out their open doors as a contributor to their deaths. This possibly explains how how this idea came into family legend. But there were also direct experiences of the next generation that would colour telling of the strange Great War bombings. Reginald was called up again in the Second World War and during the Battle of Britain was &quot;standing on a balcony [with another officer] watching an aerial dogfight overhead when a spent cannon shell hit the other man, killing him.&quot;  My grandfather described his own memories of air-raids:</p>
<blockquote>
In September 1940 we were staying temporarily on our home in Acton.I remember watching dockland burning on the night of September 7. Every night for some weeks we slept under the kitchen table, pushed under the staircase for further protection. I remember Brian, who was 9, saying during one very noisy air raid, 'Mummy, I don't want to die.' It could easily have happened. A bomb dropped in the front garden of the house directly opposite us, but the blast went the other way and our house was hardly damaged.</blockquote>
<p>From these you can see how&nbsp;the naivety&nbsp;of someone wanting to look could become attached to a convenient&nbsp;relative. In general going into the street says something about the period we want to be true -&nbsp;it reflects how we retrospectively see the First World War. Bombers over London were an intrusion of the ugly twentieth century on a world that didn't know it was coming. We want them to be drawn to the novelty, like a child playing with a brightly coloured snake. We want to offer them&nbsp;a moment of realisation, to&nbsp;understand if nothing else, before that innocence is lost.</p>
<p>But it's rare we're given that chance. It becomes clear only in retrospect when one world is over and another begun.</p>
<p>Another distant uncle (as so many of these stories involve by necessity) William Pullen died in the Somme. On school trips to the battlefields my siblings and I would look for his name. When they found the collection of soldiers’ wills last year I requested a copy of his. He left all his possessions to his mother.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There's more to say about Harry aside &quot;he died&quot;. He was a gifted musician from a family of musicians. He went to study at the Royal Academy of Music and while he's there he meets a girl, Jessie, who he performed in a duo with for several years before they get married (newspaper reports of these performances are a reminder that not only sad things are documented). They have a daughter together - and here is where things start to go wrong.</p>
<p>In what was either an exasperation of a long-standing problem or else a sudden change he becomes deeply unwell - both delusional and depressed. He goes home to Wales, but his mother can't handle caring for both her mentally disabled daughter (Elsie) and her increasingly manic and violent son - so she commits him to a local asylum.</p>
<p>After a few months there their daughter dies and Harry is checked out by his father (his absence from the family home suggests he may have away with Jessie and the baby). The discharge says he's 'unimproved' and he's back in within six months. He spends the next three years in the asylum.</p>
<p>He slowly improves. He starts eating more, the doctors note he's happier when playing the piano.  Eventually he leaves the asylum. He moves back to London and starts teaching the violin again. Within a year his house explodes and he dies being thrown from his bed.</p>
<p>Later Elsie would also be committed to the asylum as her parents became less able to care for her. She died inside of an epileptic fit after never speaking a word in her life. The family stayed in touch with Jessie, my granddad writes about meeting her.</p>

					<p>This is an excerpt from a much longer piece on the history of suicide
and journalism. &nbsp;It contains description of suicide&nbsp;methods only in so
far as they are required to demonstrate the point being made.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Across a number of countries there are media guidelines on suicide
reporting (most voluntary, but New Zealand’s are governed by law). These
arrived in the UK in 2006 when the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)
added a new clause to the Editors’ Code of Practice, extending the
guidelines on reporting on topics likely to involve personal grief with
an explicit prohibition on publishing ‘excessive detail’ about suicide
methods. The article now reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt;5. Intrusion into grief or shock</p>
<p>&gt;i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and
approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication
handled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report
legal proceedings, such as inquests.</p>
<p>ii) When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive
detail about the method used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule has now been in effect for eight years and there have now been
sufficient cases to make determinations on what exactly this rule has
meant in practice. How have complaints turned out? What exactly is
‘excessive’ detail?</p>
<p>There have been forty-six complaints under this clause - most complaints
are brought by relatives of the deceased, with a small number being
triggered by suicide prevention organisations&nbsp;or elected officials. In
one case the PCC itself brought the complaint against
fourteen&nbsp;newspapers over the same story.</p>
<p>Many complaints are resolved with an apology or a voluntary redaction of
their online archive by the newspaper - but in some cases the PCCs
reasoning over what level of detail is or isn’t ‘excessive’ becomes
clearer. Examining all rulings involving 5.ii, I found that the PCC to
date have chosen to interpret it as a rule against popularizing or
explaining unusual or technical methods of suicide. Details tend to be
allowed when the method can in some sense be seen as ‘obvious’. To use
specific cases, it is wrong to tell people how many pills are a fatal
dose or how a suicide involving a balloon kit was accomplished but it is
acceptable to describe someone as having hung themselves with their
shoelaces.</p>
<p>In the case of hanging (a minority of PCC complaints but the most common
method of suicide in the UK), the PCC has repeated argued the material
used to perform the act does not constitute part of the method. In the
very first complaint under 5.ii it was argued
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==</a>] that the
inclusion of a “photograph taken from the centre’s CCTV footage of [a
man] walking towards a stairwell with a bed sheet tied around his neck”
was not excessive as the rule was ‘designed to prevent the inclusion of
detail in newspaper reports that might provoke ‘copycat’ suicides. The
inclusion of a photograph of the complainant’s father before his death
did not raise an issue under this part of the Code.’ Similarly, in 2011
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==</a>] a complaint
that about including the fact that someone had hung ‘himself with
shoelaces’ was included in the headline was rejected, arguing that “the
article had only referred to the material with which the complainant had
hanged himself. The Commission found that the reference under complaint
did not represent an excessive detail such that would represent a breach
of the Code.”.</p>
<p>The PCC also rejected a complaint in 2008 that inclusion of a picture of
a noose in a story about suicides in Bridgend was an excessive amount of
detail - “It had to have regard to the fact that – regrettably – there
had been a spate of deaths by hanging, and that this fact was
well-known. The picture of the noose did not make public anything new
about the deaths, or describe the actual process by which individuals
had used particular materials to take their own lives.”</p>
<p>This approach is a problem because contrary to the idea that everybody
already knows how to hang themselves, information about exact hanging
techniques varies and even minor details can change how attractive the
idea of hanging is to a person. Biddle et al. [1] conducted a study with
people who had attempted suicide explicitly aimed at finding out why
they did or didn’t choose hanging as a method. People who tried hanging
believed it would be quick, easy and could be done with materials to
hand. People who did not believed it would be slow, painful or that they
lacked the technical know-how or rope to make the noose. This last point
is especially important, for hanging object is method - this is
information that change the desirability of the method. The PCC fixation
on technical or pharmaceutical suicides misses the purpose of the rule -
the concealment of unnecessary elements that might change the likelihood
someone puts into practice a given method.</p>
<p>As shown earlier [in not published sections], method and suicidal intent
is highly interlinked - restricting methods (either through physical
restrictions or by creating ignorance) is the most effective way of
having an effect on suicide across a society. This is the area where the
scientific evidence is most certain and if journalists can be convinced
of this solitary point it would account for most of the effect any wider
restrictions would give. The PCC (or its successor body) needs to take
into scope ‘obvious’ suicide methods and descriptions that might make
them more salient in the mind of a reader. These are after all the most
common and so an area where efforts would be likely to have the most
impact.</p>

					<p>(This post contains spoilers - if you’re planning to play probably don’t
read? But you can if you want. I'm not your dad or
anything.)</p>
<p>In Gone Home, only one thing really happens. You read letters, you put
tapes into cassette players, gain access to parts of the house initially
locked off, but there is only one action you take that causes the world
to change irrevocably (and while effective, it’s a bit of a cheat
really). I think this more than anything gives a feel for the kind of
game this is, one based around reflective discovery rather than action.
The world is interactive, but only really transforms in the sense that
your understanding of it changes.</p>
<p>But let’s backtrack and set the scene: It’s a dark and stormy night in
1995, player character Katie has been travelling round Europe and has
now returned home - only her family has moved and now the family house
is a place she’s never been, a house where they never finished
unpacking, where items from different eras and lives lie alongside each
other. A house where no one’s home.</p>
<p>You make your way through the house, gradually turn on the lights and
encounter the artifacts of your family’s life while you were away. As
the game progresses, three different but interconnected stories become
apparent:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Young love blooming - the story of younger sister Sam falling in love
and discovering her sexual identity - told explicitly at the player
through voiceover.</li>
<li>Marriage on the rocks - All has not been well for Katie’s parents
while she’s been away, their professional lives are on different
tracks and personally they’re drifting apart - learned through
correspondence with third parties scattered through the house.</li>
<li>Buried family history - Katie’s father Terrance was abused by his
uncle Oscar in this house -&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better">&nbsp;discoverable only from inference from
the artifacts around the
house</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thread is arguably the main story, the game ‘finishes’
(credits roll but you can still return to the house) when this story
reaches it’s end but what’s neat is it’s actually possible to get right
through the game without getting much of the third story at all. It
takes a lot of self-confidence to essentially hide so much of a story
that feeds into it’s other threads - making discovery of that story an
internal experience for the player - ‘show, don’t tell’ taken to an
extreme.</p>
<p>The most prominent way the story is told is through the voice-over of
extracts from Sam's journal - which in the initial entry we're told she
is using as a substitute for her normal conversations with Katie and so
is structured as a series of letters to the player character. The
distinction between player and character in the game has been most
looked at with the time the <a class="reference external" href="http://deadpixel.co/2013/08/not-gonna-happen/">character puts down and won't pick up
again</a> a diary entry
where Sam describes her first sexual experience with her girlfriend
(Katie’s ‘voice’ in the story is otherwise only really ‘heard’ through
the hover-over description she gives certain items) but to me the most
important distinction is the player is hearing these voice-overs,
contextualising objects with a history - Katie is not. Katie doesn't
come into possession of the letters until the last second of the game -
until that point the player has much more knowledge of what’s going on
than she does.</p>
<p>This actually also throws the diary entry into a different light -
without the voice-overs to guide us through the nascent relationship
Katie has a very different set of information to the player. She is
given a few visual hints that her sister is gay (a men's magazine in her
locker earns a 'oh my' label) and that there's a interestingly prominent
girl in her life, but this is I believe the first time Katie learns that
the relationship is romantic/sexual. We also have no idea exactly what
Katie's opinion of her sister's sexuality is. Katie is more
'conventional' than her sister - she actually answered the question on
her sex ed paper unlike Sam's (amazing) short story on the subject. The
player, eighteen years later on the far side of 'don't ask/don't tell'
(which is a period detail now!) and primed by hearing the story of young
love in Sam's own voice, might well be be feeling much more comfortable
with this than Katie is in that moment. We simply don't know. The player
character is going through an emotional journey at a very different rate
to the player and there's an interesting possibility of dissonance
there. Similarly in the final movement from cupboard under the stairs to
the attic, the player has been primed by the voiceover to expect
something very different to what Katie might be thinking - did you run?
Would Katie have?</p>
<p>As the genre demands the house is riddled with secret passages and
hidden doors (mostly justified, the passages all make sense as giving
servants access to certain parts of the house without crossing the main
spaces). As the story is essentially structured geographically,
staggering access to these passages allows for something open plan (a
house) to be re-funneled into a mostly linear story.&nbsp;This isn’t just
used as a structure convenience, creeping around these poorly lit
passages is used to put you in the world of the several different sets
of characters have also used these passages - creeping behind the
acceptable history and ideas of the family. Sam and her girlfriend use
the passages for privacy, but there’s also the inference that the
passage to the guest room is how uncle Oscar got his nephew from the
second floor down to the recesses off the basement undetected (to
reinforce this, an artifact of Oscar is found underneath the door frame
at the top of the passage, while an artifact of Terrance is found in the
cupboard at the end of the route in the basement- a path connected by
objects out of place).</p>
<p>Much has been written about how <a class="reference external" href="http://iam.benabraham.net/2013/08/gone-home-jump-scares-and-ludonarative-harmony/">Gone Home plays with and subverts
horror
tropes</a>
- there’s the light-bulb that coincidently breaks the moment the player
examines a creepy object (the ‘one action’ I’m talking about in the
first paragraph) but there’s also the the blood-stained bath with the...
oh, hair dye bottle next to it. One particular way the game mixes mood
and game design to create a storytelling moment is so simple it’s
genius. Coming out of the basement there’s a staircase with a pipe
running along the ceiling, as you move up the stairs the way a section
of the pipe breaks against the light at the top of the stairs gives the
illusion (as the shape of the section cutting off the light changes) of
a figure moving at the top. So far, so creepy - but this staircase is
along that path from guest bedroom to basement and once you've got the
idea of a shadowy figure moving up those stairs your brain is engaged
(even after you realise it’s just a pipe) and you might wonder why, if
there was one, a shadowy figure might be taking that particular route -
a clue to help you twig aspects of the Oscar story. Possible I'm
over-reading into that, but the possibility of story-telling through
optical illusion is a nifty thing.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting little meta-commentary about the game’s use of
horror game conventions in the change in Terrance’s novels over time. In
the basement there’s a note from Terrance’s father, an english lit
scholar commending him on publication of his sci-fi novel but commenting
harshly that the book is bound by cliché and genre conventions - a
phrase from this letter &quot;You can do better&quot; is recreated on big sheets
of paper in the office (you discover these in the opposite order,
transforming the faintly pathetic mantra into a deeply depressing one as
you find the source).</p>
<p>By the end of the story Terrance’s confidence has been revitalised and
he has after twenty years completed another novel in his time-travel
series- described as more introspective (where the hero doesn't save the
President's life but his own!) - trying to finally live up to his dad's
instruction to complete himself as an artist by turning inward, but in a
way that rejects the idea that it is the genre conventions that were
holding him back. I see this as a comment on ‘Gone Home’ itself and the
idea that video games can only become ‘art’ if they ditch the
conventions of their more populist output. The game does neat things in
part because the world it creates is so aware of genre expectations and
sees their inclusion (and subversion) as a way to deepen the experience
it creates. An introspective novel with a time machine.</p>

					<p><em>(Spoilers for Black Mirror, &nbsp;11/22/63&nbsp;- minor spoilers for
Caprica,&nbsp;Buffy, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf - but you know, read it anyway.)</em></p>
<p>At what point does it become wrong to want to change the way things are?</p>
<p>While it is natural to want this at the heart of so many stories is the
idea that at some point trying to change the universe becomes unhealthy
and&nbsp;monstrous. Anxiety in this mould about technological progress has
been a feature of science fiction since the beginning - but anxiety
about technological progress&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;really about technology, what
‘science is bad’ is really saying is that people are bad and that the
ability science gives us to control our own destiny will distort and
twist us in the most fundamental ways.</p>
<p>Black Mirror definitely buys into this relationship between the bad
people and their toys. <em>The National Anthem</em> argues that modern
technology is bringing us closer to animals rather than lifting us above
(although I’m not convinced the story <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/12/black-mirror-the-media-and-the-mob/">pulled off the mob aspect that
well</a>),
<em>The Entire History of You</em> and <em>Be Right Back</em> share a theme that the
imperfection of memory is a blessing that keeps us from living in the
past and technology that allows us to re-experience things we’ve lost
keeps us from growing as people.</p>
<p><em>Be Right Back</em>&nbsp;deals with Martha, who after the death of her husband
(Ash) is signed up to a internet start-up that given access to the
social media profiles of the dead can recreate their personality, given
voice samples can call you on the phone, and given photos (plus money)
can send you a robot to take their place. This shares a lot of DNA with
the Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica, where a major set of plot
threats are various character’s ambitions for protagonist Zoe’s (who
‘dies’ in the first episode) resurrection&nbsp;computer program. Like <em>Be
Right Back</em>, Caprica’s method of resurrection is based on the equivalent
of scouring social networks and the internet but in Caprica’s case this
is actually good enough and the end results are effectively perfect
copies of the original people.</p>
<p>In <em>Be Right Back</em> Robot Ash’s presence is harmful because he
simply&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;a good enough copy to replace the original, what was meant
to displace grief ends up extending it. Caprica looks more towards the
social fallout of the possible end of death. From Clarice’s plans to
create a heaven for martyrs of her religion to Daniel’s plans to sell
the technology and make it available widely (complete with promo video
of a man stepping out from behind his coffin to his grieving family)
there is no doubt that the technology works, simply how it is going to
be used. Robot Ash is flawed because the story model requires a fatal
flaw (like these <a class="reference external" href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/">great tales of caveman science
fiction</a>).
Using technology (or magic) to address your desires (resulting from
ambition, grief) will only create monsters - either figurative or
literal.</p>
<p>Something that’s fun with these kind of stories is to think about how
the possible future society that’s got over these issues will look back
on them. If you could be resurrected from your social networks and it
could be perfect - would this be wrong? Would resurrection really be so
bad for us as a society? If the technology was perfect (say people made
regular backups) would a version of Ash who could only talk out of a
mobile phone be a completely different order than if the car accident
had just paralysed him? Isn’t it really another degree of the great
spectrum of disability? What I wonder is if this is the kind of attitude
that people in a few hundred years are going to find rather quaint -
will they be horrified at the&nbsp;frailness&nbsp;of all those people who went
through their lives without the wifi chip in their skull taking backups,
and a little amused that we thought their deathless society would be an
unnatural, wrong place?</p>
<p>The end of death is one of the keystones of the transhumanist future and
different approaches abound everywhere in science fiction. In
Bear’s&nbsp;<em>Eon</em>&nbsp;universe, the inhabitants of Axis City get two chances in
a physical body before an indefinite existence in city memory. In
Clarke’s<em>&nbsp;City and The Star</em>s in order to make immortality viable
over millions of years without society growing stale (which fails, but
anyway) the people of Diaspar use a form of reincarnation, where people
are given twenty years or so to establish new lives before their
previous memories are returned to them. In Red Dwarf dead crew can be
bought back to life as holograms and the dead are a growing force in
society, when Rimmer is whining about being dead Lister just argues that
“death isn’t the handicap it used to be in the olden days.
It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;screw your career up the way it used to”.</p>
<p>There is a similar approach to the sanctity of death in fantasy where,
despite the otherwise strangeness of the world, often reversing ‘natural
death’ remains an uncrossable line. Magical worlds that co-exist with
the real world tend to certain rules to explain why the real world is
only superficially altered from our own with the addition of these
fantastic elements, usually in some form of unwritten Prime Directive of
non-interference - the specific problem being that magical rules tend to
be fair (in the sense that all actions can be reversed - at a cost)
whereas the real world is notably for being distinctly unfair. Harry
Potter's world has a host of magical ailments for magical healers to fix
but St Mungo’s doesn’t go around curing muggles of cancer. In Buffy,
Joyce and Tara are explicitly unable to be resurrected through magical
means because of the non-magical nature of the deaths and season five’s
<em>Forever</em> dwells on the horrificness of trying to break this rule. While
the real- and other-world mix to some degree, real-world death is
repeatedly treated as a line the other just can't cross, or at least not
lightly.</p>
<p>In science fiction this comes up quite a lot in stories about time
travel - attempts to fix real-world wrongs using otherworldly
time-travel are frequently the source rather than remedy of regret.
As<em>&nbsp;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</em> puts it
&quot;within a science fictional space, memory and regret are, when taken
together, the set of necessary and sufficient elements required to
produce a time machine&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Whoverse this happens most explicitly
in <em>Father’s Day</em> when Rose's attempt to save her father literally
breaks the story-world apart and lets monsters in from beyond the fourth
wall to teach her a lesson. The Tenth Doctor's “Time Lord Victorious”
speech in <em>Waters of Mars</em> is effectively him declaring his refusal to
let his otherworldlyness bind his actions, hubris the story punishes him
for in short succession. However this is a line that Who is increasingly
fuzzy on, at the end of the <em>The Almost People</em> the Doctor gives Cleaves
what is in effect a magic potion to fix the brain clot in her brain.
Like Joyce’s aneurysm in Buffy, the clot isn't caused by the Doctor or
the events of the story, it's presented as a decidedly human problem
that's solved (in a moment) through magical means. Similarly, in last
year’s Christmas episode a normal man was flying back in a doomed plane
from a normal war and is rescued from death through essentially magical
means.</p>
<p>When a story is showing the dark side of Trying To Change How Things
Were it tends to show history breaking in two ways. In Red Dwarf’s
<em>Tikka to Ride</em> Kennedy’s assassination is accidentally prevented,
leading to an alternate history where Kennedy’s failings of a president
are given time to play out, leading to an earlier and different end to
the Cold War where the future the show is set in no longer exist, while
in Stephen King’s <em>11/22/63</em> time&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;want to be changed, and the
act of doing so on a large enough scale (preventing the Kennedy
assassination) breaks the universe, with earthquakes, disasters and a
decay of the laws of physics. One teaches the a lesson that history is
complicated and events have unexpected repercussions, the other that
meddling in the past is just Wrong with a capital W and you will be
punished for doing so.</p>
<p>At their core Black Mirror and the range of similar stories&nbsp;are
essentially conservative in the 'people aren't getting any better'
sense, but this also spills over into 'attempts to make people better
will always fail' - because the one thing we certainly can't be trusted
to change right is ourselves.&nbsp;A future where people play pick 'n' mix
with their memories, change history on a whim, and the dead walk on the
streets demanding equal rights is certainly weird and unsettling to us
today - but wouldn’t they find stories demanding a ‘dead’ person go away
so everyone else can move on a little bit horrifying themselves?</p>

					<p>Bit late to get around to this, but here's a quick round-up of
everything I wrote on the blog last year (in vague theme groupings):</p>
<p>There have been posts about&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/02/political-chickens/">the history of chicken suits in
politics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/facebook-and-the-legible-person/">Facebook
is trying to make us more
legible</a>.
I <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/progress-of-the-boundary-reviews/">went to a talk on the boundary
reviews</a>,&nbsp;and
in a piece of high-nerdery worked out&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/electoral-reform-at-the-oscars/">the exact problem in the
electoral
system</a>&nbsp;for
the Oscars.&nbsp;There's also some number-crunching on&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/how-political-is-eurovision-voting-really/">political&nbsp;voting in
Eurovision</a>,
&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/does-photoshopping-politicians-mislead-the-electorate/">weird and revealing complaint about a&nbsp;political&nbsp;ad in New
Zealand</a>&nbsp;and
an attempt to make sense of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/the-strange-maths-of-mandates/">weird world of political
mandates</a>.</p>
<p>I ended up writing a fair amount on the Scottish&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;referendum
-&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/indyref-round-up/">I&nbsp;summarised arguments made to the Scottish Affairs
Committee</a>,&nbsp;explored&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/seats-for-powers/">the
history and problems of the 'seats for powers'
argument</a>,
looked at the<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/votes-at-16-in-scotland/">practical implications of votes at 16 in
Scotland</a>
and thought that <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/scottish-independence-and-the-electoral-register/">early&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;arguments about electoral register
seemed
spurious</a>.&nbsp;On
the release of section 30 order I noticed it <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/designated-campaigns-for-an-independence-referendum/">seemed to be giving
&nbsp;powers to the Scottish Parliament it said it
wasn't</a>,
something <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/update-on-designated-campaigns/">that seemed to be
confirmed</a>
a few months later. &nbsp;Still not sure where that one's going. (and from
2011 -&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">a post on multiple questions and ballot
design</a>.)</p>
<p>Looking at democratic stuff, I wrote there's a good case to be made
for&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">allowing fractional voting below
18</a>&nbsp;and
that if it caused problems that's not terrible because&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/">democracy
should
be&nbsp;disruptive</a>,&nbsp;put
down some thoughts on&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/pcc-elections-some-loose-thoughts-on-authorisation-in-elections/">exactly what we mean when we talk about
authorisation in
elections</a>&nbsp;and
pointed out&nbsp;that&nbsp;Gilad Sharon&nbsp;seemed to be making <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/london-and-gaza-can-democratic-citizens-be-held-responsible-for-their-governments/">a very similar
argument about
democratic&nbsp;accountability</a>&nbsp;to
that made by the 7/7 bombers.</p>
<p>In the misc section, I looked at<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/slut-dropping-how-disgust-spreads-urban-legends/">&nbsp;'slut dropping' in the context of
wider writing on urban
legends</a>,

things</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/mps-haircuts-and-debt/">barbers and debt
moralism</a>,&nbsp;and
examined&nbsp;the Church of England's generous view of its history on gay
rights as&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/same-sex-marriage-is-sexist-and-other-stories/">it argued that allowing same-sex marriage would be
sexist</a>.&nbsp;When
in a&nbsp;#slatepitches&nbsp;mood, I argued we shouldn't limit ourselves
to&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/cash-4-rights-why-stop-in-the-workplace/">selling off workplace
rights</a>&nbsp;and
asked what the problem really is with&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/is-cash-for-honours-a-good-deal/">cash for
honours</a>?</p>
<p>With my pop-culture hat on, I looked at how sci-fi is working over
<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/its-like-ive-landed-on-a-different-planet-the-imagery-of-911-in-sci-fi/">the&nbsp;imagery&nbsp;of

of the future in the Prometheus&nbsp;promo
videos</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;how
the Walking Dead video game used the <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/ethics-and-consequences-in-the-walking-dead-game/">pointlessness of choice to create
an
ethical&nbsp;environment</a>.&nbsp;I
saw&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/07/the-dark-knight-who-rises/">The Dark Knight
Rises</a>&nbsp;and
read&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/the-long-earth/">The Long
Earth</a>.</p>
<p>In total that's 25,000 words on this blog last year, only 2000 less than
what I wrote doing my Masters course at the same time. I think I've
gotten better at this whole blogging thing over all those words, but
mileage may vary.&nbsp;As ever,&nbsp;apologies for people looking for the train
forum that used to be on the smokefilledroom domain who the stats say
make up a chunk of my visitors - I'll try and cater to you more this
year.</p>
