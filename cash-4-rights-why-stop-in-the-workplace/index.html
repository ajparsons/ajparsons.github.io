				Oct 09, 2012
                
				
					<p>Yesterday George&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;floated proposals that employers could offer
contracts that exchange '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9593955/George-Osborne-workers-of-the-world-unite...and-give-up-your-employment-rights.html">workplace rights for tax-free shares in the
company</a>'.
While on the surface, this is trading hard-won employment rights for
magic beans that may or may not be worth much (and in many businesses'
cases, a wily employer could make it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/10/the-fundamental-problem-with-osbornes-employee-ownership-plan">worth very little
indeed</a>)
that's no reason to be harsh on the principle which could be used for
any number of things - what are other rights worth?</p>
<p>Have a look through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art15">European Convention on Human
Rights</a> and ask
yourself, am I really ever going to use that?&nbsp;Take the prohibition in
Article 2 against the death penalty, even when we had it in the 20th
century we only executed around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats">11 people a
year</a>. Using
the 1900 population stats (which only increase and so make this even
more favourable) and assuming a life span of 80, I only have a&nbsp;0.002%
chance* of being&nbsp;executed in my lifetime &nbsp;- &nbsp;might I not be happy to
take few quid a year to waive&nbsp;my right not be executed?</p>
<p>Of course, no one is going to offer me money to waive that right&nbsp;for
exactly the same reason it might be appealing, &nbsp;it's not worth much to
me because the chances of execution are low and it's not worth much to
other people because the number of people wanting to execute me is also
low (hopefully). &nbsp;In the case for employment rights for shares, the
reasoning is that&nbsp;these are rights that people are quite likely to
exercise, but actually things would be better if they didn't.&nbsp;The ideal
situation for everyone is one where the right is worth very little to me
but quite a lot to someone else and there's an obvious candidate for
this - voting rights.</p>
<p>It's a famous problem for rational choice explanations of voting
behaviour&nbsp;that the benefit to the individual of voting is tiny compared
even to the very cheap costs of voting as the chances that your vote is
the one that changes the outcome is so tiny that taking it seriously is
like planning a route to work that avoids lottery-funded asteroid
strikes**. For those of us voting in safe seats we can be pretty
confident that our vote is almost entirely useless. &nbsp;The fact that
turnout still tends to be much higher than the 0% it should be is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting">Downs
Paradox</a>, and most
ways of resolving it rely on people voting on matters other than
self-interest, such as loyalty to the group or candidate, or even just
people think that voting is a Good Thing that should be encouraged and
gone through, even if the benefits to yourself are limited.</p>
<p>But what if we made it even more expensive to vote (or vote freely) by
offering money the other way?&nbsp;When <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172644/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/14/News/Most-Say.Their.Vote.Has.A.Price-3099547.shtml">a class of NYU students was polled
in
2007</a>,
two-thirds would exchange their vote for a free year of&nbsp;tuition, half
for a million dollars and&nbsp;&nbsp;20% were as cheap as an iPod Touch (then
between $300-400).&nbsp;This isn't just good for candidates and my wallet,
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pedrovicente.org/banho.pdf">study looking at São Tomé and
Príncipe</a>&nbsp;found that
decreasing vote-buying also hurt voter turnout and
increased&nbsp;incumbent&nbsp;advantage - which are bad things!</p>
<p>There may of course be downsides I'm missing to this, but while we're
working out which-rights-are-worth-how-much it's definitely something to
think about.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>*&nbsp;This is about the same odds as getting a straight flush in poker.
Here's the question, did me telling you that make you feel being
executed is more or less&nbsp;likely?&nbsp;Straight flushes are possible, your
chances of seeing one in every game you've ever played or seen are much
higher than the chances of getting one in your first game ever (which as
my odds were over a lifetime is equivalent). Likewise dramatic hands are
more likely to appear <a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">in film or TV
depictions</a>.
This is a problem because when I give an example of&nbsp;probability&nbsp;your
brain does a trick where instead of working on the odds, it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100184181/why-we-need-to-teach-parents-about-risk-and-statistics-in-the-wake-of-the-april-jones-horror/">tries to
think of an example of the thing
being&nbsp;described</a>
to assess the likelihood of it happening. Hence me giving the example of
a straight flush makes 0.002% seem far, far more&nbsp;likely&nbsp;than it actually
is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically we're terrible with risk.</p>
<p>** Note: may actually be more likely than that.</p>
