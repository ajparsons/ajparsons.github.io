					<p>A 2000 Paul Krugman
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html">article</a>&nbsp;arguing
the problems of rent control was going round twitter yesterday in
response to Miliband rent control proposals in the UK. Ignoring the fact
the Miliband's rent control is a controlled-rise system rather the the
traditional set-up Krugman attacks, anyone who finds his San Francisco
example scary doesn't really understand the current problems in the
housing market:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side, consider an article that appeared in yesterday's
New York Times, ''In San Francisco, Renters Are Supplicants.'' It
was an interesting piece, with its tales of would-be renters
spending months pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate
applicants arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress
the landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something
crucial missing -- specifically, two words I knew had to be part of
the story.</p>
<p>Not that I have any special knowledge about San Francisco's housing
market -- in fact, as of yesterday morning I didn't know a thing
about it. But it was immediately obvious from the story what was
going on. To an economist, or for that matter a freshman who has
taken Economics 101, everything about that story fairly screamed
those two words -- which are, of course, ''rent control.''</p>
<p>After all, the sort of landlord behavior described in the article --
demanding that prospective tenants supply resumes and credit
reports, that they dress nicely and act enthusiastic -- <strong>doesn't
happen in uncontrolled housing markets</strong> [emphasis&nbsp;mine]. Landlords
don't want groveling -- they would rather have money. In
uncontrolled markets the question of who gets an apartment is
settled quickly by the question of who is able and willing to pay
the most. And so I had no doubts about what I would find after a bit
of checking -- namely, that San Francisco is a city where a
technology-fueled housing boom has collided with a draconian
rent-control law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to be too scared by this doomsday vision of prospective
tenants at the mercy of strange landlord demands because this is pretty
close to what I've actually experienced. I've <a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/invasive-referencing/">written about it
before</a>
but one place we almost moved the landlord, despite the fact the letting
agent would do a reference check, demanded to see bank statements and
have a meeting with us before accepting our offer. &nbsp;This wasn't a
friendly&nbsp;meeting, it was&nbsp;an aggressive &quot;how do I know you won't leave
early&quot;, &quot;how stable are your jobs&quot;, &quot;you don't have friends and parties
right&quot; meeting.&nbsp;You got the impression quickly he was of the &quot;unexpected
visit&quot; school of bad landlords and having come from another bad landlord
situation we got the deposit back and moved into another place. Here we
spent the next year dealing with mould, rats, mice and cockroaches, but
the choice&nbsp;we made was absolutely the right one. That would not have
been a good landlord to have.</p>
<p>This can't be dismissed as &quot;just one creep&quot;.&nbsp;Looking at bank statements
is a practice defended on landlord forums because of the &quot;risk&quot;
landlords take by being landlords.&nbsp;Another place wasn't even interested
in renting a two double-bedroom place to a group of three because they
were looking for &quot;professionals&quot; rather than people who knew each other
- essentially they wanted people with few connections who would treat
the place as a dormitory&nbsp;rather than a place to be lived or socialised
in&nbsp;(with the &quot;risks&quot; that might entail).</p>
<p>But London doesn't have rent control - if the landlord had so many
offers that they could afford to be picky why don't they just raise the
price? Don't they just want money? The way to make sense of this is&nbsp;that
the wrong people operate the private rental sector. In 2010 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf">a private
landlord&nbsp;survey</a>
found that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eighty-nine per cent of landlords were private individual landlords
responsible for 71% of all private rented dwellings, with a further
5% of landlords being company landlords responsible for 15% of
dwellings.</li>
<li>More than three quarters (78%) of all landlords only owned a single
dwelling for rent, with only 8% of landlords stating they were full
time landlords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale landlords are the major player in the rental sector and
they're not always going to be good capitalists. The ones that act like
the above&nbsp;are risk-adverse and want their investment bothering them as
little as possible.&nbsp;If the amount of money you are willing to accept to
balance the greater perceived risk is greater&nbsp;than the difference
between the price where you have one buyer and and the price where you
have enough choice to chose less risky tenants, you will charge less
than you can and screen. &nbsp;People who will put up with this before even
moving in are likely to be less troublesome, less likely to make demands
of work that cost money/require attention, less likely to understand
their legal situation, etc. This is a better and more comfortable
position for the investor-landlord.&nbsp;The rate of return&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996">is still
ridiculous</a>&nbsp;regardless.</p>
<p>When people say that rent control means that properties&nbsp;won't be
maintained and landlords will have invasive and offensive tests of
potential tenants I'm not scared of rent control - I'm scared people
don't seem to understand the full extent of the problem. We clearly&nbsp;do
not live&nbsp;a housing market where tenants are only discriminated against
on the size of the wallets - when your uncontrolled situation is pretty
close to the controlled bogeyman something has gone very wrong.</p>
