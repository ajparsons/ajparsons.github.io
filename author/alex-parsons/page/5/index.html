					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/245px-David_Lloyd_George-230x300.jpg" />David Cameron is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9606608/David-Cameron-Honours-for-cash-No-problem.html">reported to have
said</a>
to&nbsp;a gathering of donors at the Conservative Party conference:</p>
<blockquote>
“Look, I have no problem giving honours to donors,”&nbsp;David
Cameron&nbsp;declared. “They are doing a public service, in my view.
Otherwise, we’d have to turn to state funding of our political
parties, which would just add to our deficit and be totally
unacceptable.”</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, I find myself agreeing with him.&nbsp;Parties are
essential to the democratic system ticking over, parties need money to
run, parties need to get money from somewhere. I think there's an
excellent case for state funding of parties but if in the meantime we
have cash in one set of hands and in the other set of hands we have
honours that people like (but don't really mean that much) that seems a
fair deal.</p>
<p>There is the little snag here: selling honours is a criminal offence
under the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/72/section/1">Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act
1925</a>&nbsp;and
you have to wonder if the&nbsp;&quot;giving me money is a public good and people
should be rewarded for contributing to the public good&quot; line is really
enough not to fall foul of this. The offence was&nbsp;introduced after Lloyd
George was quite brazenly selling off&nbsp;honours&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://everything2.com/user/aneurin/writeups/Lloyd+George+and+the+Honours+Scandal">for party
funding</a>&nbsp;(his&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;went
so far as to have&nbsp;&quot;a published tariff with a knighthood being available
for £10,000, a baronetcy for £30,000, with a peerage title costing
upwards of £50,000&quot;). The big trouble is peerages as these bestow some
actual power with a seat in House of Lords - but assuming the Lords was
abolished for a minute, what's the objection? There is the perception of
corruption when rich people give things to parties and get nice things
in return, but does a knighthood really have much utility beyond feeling
quite nice?</p>
<p>A party system funding&nbsp;solely&nbsp;by the rich gives the wrong incentives but
we could refine this to give everyone an incentive to get involved:&nbsp;why
not open it up and officialise&nbsp;Cash for Honours by making the process a
lottery? People have given money into the various party pots - pick a
few pounds out and bestow a few honours that way. If you operate a few
different pots for different donation ranges, a&nbsp;fair amount will end up
with the same set of wealthy donors, but it will also introduce a chance
that everyday party supporters could be rewarded for the noble work of
ensuring our&nbsp;political&nbsp;system's wheels stay&nbsp;greased.</p>
<p>I'm being a little&nbsp;facetious here and this process would raise all kinds
of questions (a knighthood for donating to the BNP?) but I think the
core question is a good one: why is the idea of the&nbsp;government&nbsp;using its
ability to bestow honours to fund these vital democratic functions
inherently bad?</p>

					<p>Looking back on my child voting notes I remembered an argument that I
didn't touch on last time <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">I wrote about votes for
children</a>:
&nbsp;that children's different experiences alone, regardless of any question
of&nbsp;competence&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to justify&nbsp;representation.</p>
<p>What often annoys me about Votes at 16 arguments is that so many of the
arguments deployed are incredibly regressive.&nbsp;Children can pay tax, they
should vote! And we'll take away the vote from adults who don't? &nbsp;If we
lived in democracies with property requirements child voting advocates
would be arguing that 16-year-olds can own property and should vote, not
that there's something wrong with the basic idea.&nbsp;Fundamentally there's
no difference between this tax position and<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/">Ian Cowie's
idea</a>
that only those who paid more than £100 income tax should be allowed to
vote, which itself isn't a long way removed from an argument that the
rich pay for more more of the state, why shouldn't they have more of a
say?</p>
<p>British democracy has its origins in exactly this idea of a stakeholder
democracy, expanding to include any group that might threaten it from
the outside. But the real merit of democracy is that it is so disruptive
of existing norms - democracy shouldn't simply reflect other power
structures (the rich having more of a say than others, men wielding more
decision making power than women) but should work to undermine those
structures by expressing the always radical notion that
everyone&nbsp;deserves&nbsp;an equal say.</p>
<p>Children represent a distinct interest, a massive consumer of state
services (which occupy and direct a large amount of their time) and yet
the argument often deployed is that they are so like us that it would
unfair not to include them, not that they are so different we are
missing a vital voice. As <a class="reference external" href="http://chd.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/06/0907568211406756">Wall put
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]hildren may not always have as much autonomy or power as adults,
but they are every bit as different. If the purpose of democratic
representation is to respond to the fullest possible diversity of
social experiences, then it includes responding to children – and to
children’s endless diversity – just as much as it does to adults.
Indeed, children would take on a heightened status as the most
important test of being democratic, since they are more likely than
most to call for political responsiveness from the whole. <strong>Being
represented in the political sphere should not depend entirely on
how competently one can argue for one’s interests or how effectively
one can struggle against others for power. It should depend finally
on how different one’s experiences are from those of others.</strong> (p.
10)</p>
<p>The right to vote should be as expansive as possible because those
voted into office are given power over the lives of all. It should
be presumed that everyone can vote unless a compelling argument can
be provided for exclusion. Children’s right to vote is important if
elected representatives are to perform their democratic duties of
challenging historical marginalization and responding to
constituents’ fullest differences. (p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this perspective because the notion of letting children vote is
unsettling is an excellent reason to do it - it will disrupt current
power relations in a way that improve society. &nbsp;There's a fine argument
that actually, children are a different class of excluded person than
all previous examples because their immaturity is transitional - one day
they will grow up, no one is&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;excluded - but for the
'democracy as difference' argument this is hollow comfort because their
'difference' representing the child's interests is lost.&nbsp;If the blanket
inclusion this implies is too radical, there are schemes <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">that represent
children on a fractional
basis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which
are at least no worse than complete exclusion).</p>
<p>My&nbsp;personal opinion on votes at 16 has always tended towards supportive
indifference, however currently&nbsp;I'm trying to write something long on
political equality and democracy and it's been eye opening to see how
many democratic theorists are just as willing to ignore the issue
('assume a population of adults' is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical
cow</a> of democratic
theory). It's becoming increasingly hard to hold to the stance that this
is an unimportant issue, in the UK the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx">proportion of the population
under
fifteen</a>
is 18% - in Iraq and Libya it's 43%, Tanzania 45%, Uganda 48%.&nbsp;In places
where the proportion of children to adults almost approaches parity,&nbsp;how
can any account of democracy that excludes children not be severely
flawed?</p>

				Oct 11, 2012
                
				
					<p>It's starting to look very much like the voting&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;will be
extended in&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;for the independence referendum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19900973">to include sixteen
and seventeen
year-olds</a>.&nbsp;I've
written before on the <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">Votes at 16
argument</a>
(shorter version: most argument for it are&nbsp;unsatisfying, interesting
approach might be&nbsp;graduated&nbsp;and fractional voting rights far below
16)&nbsp;but while I'm posting abandoned avenues from my dissertation I
thought it was worth including the section I wrote on the idea of
expanding the&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;for referendums, before giving up on that side
of the project because it seemed a bit unlikely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another possible consideration for referendums not mentioned in the
Electoral Commission report is if it’s intended for the referendum
electorate to be different (larger or smaller) from that of the
normal electorate.</p>
<p>For example, expanding the franchise to include
those 16 and 17 year-olds is something under active consideration
(but probably doubtful) for the Scottish independence referendum and
a former civil servant indicated at the Constitution Unit talk on
Scottish Independence that similar measures were considered (but
ultimately rejected) in terms of expanding the electorate were made
for the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum (in that case to
holidaymakers and those abroad).</p>
<p>When asked by the Scottish Affairs
Committee on how long the process of preparing for an expanded
electorate would take Andrew Scallan (Director of Electoral
Administration at The Electoral Commission) spent a long time not
wanting to give a precise answer as to how long the process of
expanding the registers would take (more than a week, less than a
year) but did suggest the best scenario would be legislation in the
summer followed by a household canvas in the Autumn and at other
times of year the process might be more difficult/result in a less
complete register.</p>
<p>In terms of otherwise unexplored issues of
referendum time, this could be interesting but involves quite an
expansion of scope into discussion of electoral registers
(especially in terms of the pending switchover to individual
electoral registration) for what is likely to remain a hypothetical
situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So opps on that, but practical considerations still interesting. This
might also affect future UK referendums because it diminishes the
precedent of referendums only using existing electorates - so in future
referendums we could have similar moves to try and include other un-able
to vote groups.&nbsp;Should non-EU citizens vote in a UK referendum on
leaving the EU? &nbsp;Strangely that might not even be a&nbsp;hypothetical, as EU
citizens are part of the Holyrood electorate they should be able to vote
in this one - and whether the new Scotland would automatically be an EU
member <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9303587/European-Commission-Separate-Scotland-forced-to-reapply-for-EU-membership.html">is still up for
debate</a>.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;something I hadn't picked up on before is that this isn't the only
movement on the subject in Scotland, since last year the crofting
elections franchise&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/456/regulation/4/made">extends to 16 year
olds</a>.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/100322-cam1-300x149.jpg" />This is clearly a Question To Which The Answer Is No, but bear
with me a minute. While researching for my Masters dissertation I spent
some time looking at how various&nbsp;countries&nbsp;deal with accuracy
requirements in&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising - I might convert some of my
conclusions into blog form at some point but in the meantime I'll share
a complaint I found quite funny. In New Zealand rules about accuracy in
broadcast and print apply to&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising (although this is a
rare event) and looking through the 2008 cases I found a wonderful
complaint to their Advertising Standards Agency by a man who claimed
that then PM Helen Clark was misleading the electorate by using a
photoshopped image of herself on posters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consumer in this instance is the voting public. &nbsp;Clearly what is
represented as the image of Helen Clark is intended to appeal to a
younger less knowledgeable voter. &nbsp;The Labour Party have used this
exaggerated image of a youthful vibrant younger woman as the face of
the Party to mislead the voting decisions of a less knowledgeable
group.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The visual image in the Billboard is clearly intended to mislead,
and the standard has been set by your sister organisation – the BSA
in its ruling against TV3[*]. &nbsp;They had nothing to gain from using
an actor to voice over an interview, the Labour Party have
everything to gain from misleading the voting public – even if only
by a few votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ASA rejected this, arguing that &quot;it was common practice in a
wide-range of sectors for people to take additional care with their
appearance when their image was used for publicity purposes&quot; - what
makes this extra wonderful is that the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;appealed this
decision, arguing that using photoshopped images was so deceitful it
brought the integrity of the whole party into question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Labour Party has framed Election 08 around the issue of Trust.
This is probably the most important election we as a nation has
faced for many years. As such every vote cast is important and the
voting public need to be protected from the misleading visual image
projected in the billboards (and other media).</p>
<p>A commercial trader potently can make financial gain by presenting
goods or services with professionally enhanced images. By way of
example if a used car dealer advertised an image of a vehicle that
looked pristine, then when it was inspected it was found to have
rust, mismatched paint, and no mag wheels, then the dealer is in
breach of the guidelines and consumer laws. Your august body acting
on the initiative of a complaint from the public would review the
standards and apply a ruling to remove the offending advertisement.</p>
<p>In summary, as a concerned citizen I feel compelled to act and voice
my opinion that the political party trying to project &quot;Trust&quot; as the
major focus of this election is able to knowing promote itself with
a visual presentation that is clearly and intentionally designed to
mislead a segment of the voting public and gain the favour of those
less knowledgeable. As such the billboards in question breach the
standard set out in Rule 2.</p>
<p>This is not just another advertisement by a dodgy car dealer or a
dramatization from an enthusiastic broadcaster - it is vital that
this appeal is considered carefully as it has serious and far
reaching implications for the future of New Zealand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which didn't find much favour with the appeal board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Acting Chairperson said that the identity of the Advertiser in
this Advertisement was clear, both through the authorisation
statement, the use of the identifiable party colours and name, and
through the image of the leader of the party. Regarding the question
of fact and opinion, the Acting Chairperson agreed that this element
of Rule 11 was not raised by this Advertisement. Accordingly she
ruled the Advertisement met the requirements of Rule 11 was not in
breach of it.</p>
<p>The Acting Chairperson took into account the Complainant’s concerns,
however, she was of the view, that <strong>as the Prime Minister and
leader of Labour Party, the public profile of the Rt Hon Helen
Clark, across a wide range of media, was such that the general
public would be familiar with her appearance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there's a fair case to be made that this complaint has a degree
of sexism and well as ageism to it, I find it hard (not impossible) to
imagine the same 'people wouldn't vote her if they knew she was ooolldd'
being levelled against a male&nbsp;politician? Comparing a politician's&nbsp;image
to a rusty car seems an especially thin point - when you buy a car, you
buy the car, when you vote a politicians you're not 'buying' their body.
Years later,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10824495">someone made a similar complaint to the UN ethics
office</a>&nbsp;about
a picture of her on a UN website and there's a definite&nbsp;ugliness&nbsp;about
this kind of complaint.&nbsp;We laugh about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/david-cameron-campaign-poster-rumour">Cameron
poster</a>,
but don't say it calls into question his fundamental character.</p>
<p>On the other hand, isn't it quite nice that even
this&nbsp;frivolous&nbsp;complaint was taken seriously and given (and as
the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;says, prompt) consideration?</p>
<p>* This relates to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/2752">a
decision</a> by the NZ BSA
that a broadcast that declared&nbsp;an interview used an actor's voice, but
didn't declare the silhouetted&nbsp;figure was itself an actor was in breach
of accuracy rules.</p>

					<p>Yesterday George&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;floated proposals that employers could offer
contracts that exchange '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9593955/George-Osborne-workers-of-the-world-unite...and-give-up-your-employment-rights.html">workplace rights for tax-free shares in the
company</a>'.
While on the surface, this is trading hard-won employment rights for
magic beans that may or may not be worth much (and in many businesses'
cases, a wily employer could make it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/10/the-fundamental-problem-with-osbornes-employee-ownership-plan">worth very little
indeed</a>)
that's no reason to be harsh on the principle which could be used for
any number of things - what are other rights worth?</p>
<p>Have a look through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art15">European Convention on Human
Rights</a> and ask
yourself, am I really ever going to use that?&nbsp;Take the prohibition in
Article 2 against the death penalty, even when we had it in the 20th
century we only executed around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats">11 people a
year</a>. Using
the 1900 population stats (which only increase and so make this even
more favourable) and assuming a life span of 80, I only have a&nbsp;0.002%
chance* of being&nbsp;executed in my lifetime &nbsp;- &nbsp;might I not be happy to
take few quid a year to waive&nbsp;my right not be executed?</p>
<p>Of course, no one is going to offer me money to waive that right&nbsp;for
exactly the same reason it might be appealing, &nbsp;it's not worth much to
me because the chances of execution are low and it's not worth much to
other people because the number of people wanting to execute me is also
low (hopefully). &nbsp;In the case for employment rights for shares, the
reasoning is that&nbsp;these are rights that people are quite likely to
exercise, but actually things would be better if they didn't.&nbsp;The ideal
situation for everyone is one where the right is worth very little to me
but quite a lot to someone else and there's an obvious candidate for
this - voting rights.</p>
<p>It's a famous problem for rational choice explanations of voting
behaviour&nbsp;that the benefit to the individual of voting is tiny compared
even to the very cheap costs of voting as the chances that your vote is
the one that changes the outcome is so tiny that taking it seriously is
like planning a route to work that avoids lottery-funded asteroid
strikes**. For those of us voting in safe seats we can be pretty
confident that our vote is almost entirely useless. &nbsp;The fact that
turnout still tends to be much higher than the 0% it should be is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting">Downs
Paradox</a>, and most
ways of resolving it rely on people voting on matters other than
self-interest, such as loyalty to the group or candidate, or even just
people think that voting is a Good Thing that should be encouraged and
gone through, even if the benefits to yourself are limited.</p>
<p>But what if we made it even more expensive to vote (or vote freely) by
offering money the other way?&nbsp;When <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172644/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/14/News/Most-Say.Their.Vote.Has.A.Price-3099547.shtml">a class of NYU students was polled
in
2007</a>,
two-thirds would exchange their vote for a free year of&nbsp;tuition, half
for a million dollars and&nbsp;&nbsp;20% were as cheap as an iPod Touch (then
between $300-400).&nbsp;This isn't just good for candidates and my wallet,
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pedrovicente.org/banho.pdf">study looking at São Tomé and
Príncipe</a>&nbsp;found that
decreasing vote-buying also hurt voter turnout and
increased&nbsp;incumbent&nbsp;advantage - which are bad things!</p>
<p>There may of course be downsides I'm missing to this, but while we're
working out which-rights-are-worth-how-much it's definitely something to
think about.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>*&nbsp;This is about the same odds as getting a straight flush in poker.
Here's the question, did me telling you that make you feel being
executed is more or less&nbsp;likely?&nbsp;Straight flushes are possible, your
chances of seeing one in every game you've ever played or seen are much
higher than the chances of getting one in your first game ever (which as
my odds were over a lifetime is equivalent). Likewise dramatic hands are
more likely to appear <a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">in film or TV
depictions</a>.
This is a problem because when I give an example of&nbsp;probability&nbsp;your
brain does a trick where instead of working on the odds, it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100184181/why-we-need-to-teach-parents-about-risk-and-statistics-in-the-wake-of-the-april-jones-horror/">tries to
think of an example of the thing
being&nbsp;described</a>
to assess the likelihood of it happening. Hence me giving the example of
a straight flush makes 0.002% seem far, far more&nbsp;likely&nbsp;than it actually
is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically we're terrible with risk.</p>
<p>** Note: may actually be more likely than that.</p>

					<p>(Spoilers, spoilers, this post contains spoilers).</p>
<p>Some quick assorted Dark Knight Rises thoughts. &nbsp;Looking back at some of
my previous posts like this, my usual opening writing tic is 'I liked
this film, but here's some things that were funny' - so in keeping with
that tradition I liked this film, but here's some things that were
funny.</p>
<div class="section" id="people-of-gotham">
<h2>People of Gotham</h2>
<p>I think the biggest critique possible of the film is that its most
thematically rich arena is the one most underused - the siege. &nbsp;To begin
with it's&nbsp;not clear why it's happening at all - the ticking timebomb
lends urgency to the final sequence, but why on earth is there that five
month delay? The real reason is that Bruce must be given realistic time
to overcome his physical and spiritual injuries and return to save the
day, but what’s the in-story explanation?</p>
<p>The obvious candidate is giving Gotham the chance to demonstrate it
doesn’t deserve to be saved (a reprise of the boats from the previous
film) - but this is undercut by the very little we see of Gotham’s
citizenry. It’s never really clear how much of Bane’s mob at the end is
imported or was recruited during the siege (it is implied that all along
it’s been fed by the unseen problems of the city though - ‘jobs in the
tunnels’ and all). We only have one character that buys into the
revolution and that’s Selina Kyle’s sidekick, the closest we have to a
class warrior is Selina Kyle herself, who quickly becomes disillusioned
at the results of Bane’s world (could be some fun identity stuff in
here, what’s a thief in a world without property?). Bane makes his deals
with capitalists to move the pieces into place, but where’s his similar
co-option of revolutionaries?</p>
<p>I am of course committing the classic critic mistake of demanding the
film-maker make a completely different film than the one they chose to
and it’s to the credit of the world building that you could fit a whole
mini-series (one I’d love to see) in what takes place over 15 minutes or
so - but as is, it’s hard to work out what Nolan’s actual take is here.
It’s clear that Bane isn't really in the revolution game and he's using
class conflict as the frayed thread that can be pulled to tear Gotham
apart (he’s almost mocking in handing Gotham ‘back to the people’) but
the film never really resolves if Gotham is in revolution or under
occupation - and there’s a thematic muddle as a result. How does the
film feel about Occupy? The trials for the wealthy? Is this about how
revolutions can go wrong? It might be, but we lack revolutionaries and
the only voices we hear are the ones we know to be disingenuous. Rise,
as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Want-to-Be-a-Part-of-the-Dark-Knight-Rises-Soundtrack-133435573.html">crowd-sourced
chorus</a>&nbsp;repeatedly
demands, but this isn’t a call to revolution, it's asking a great man to
appear - for an individual to climb out of the pit. The people will ask
for heroes, but they stay off the stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-robin">
<h2>The Rise of Robin</h2>
<p>Another way to look at the whole film is as a backstory for Robin (John
Blake, rhymes with Tim Drake - hey!) - what led this young police
officer to throw away his badge and take up the cape and cowl? Heroes in
this mold are are faced on both sides by agents of order and agents of
chaos and it’s the reasons they reject both that define them as
characters - Why doesn’t Bruce just join the police, why is Buffy
ill-suited for the Initiative?</p>
<p>In this light it’s worth looking at just how little John gets
accomplished in this film. Finds Commissioner Gordon, cool, realises the
masterplan to trap all the police underground (a plan that involves the
police suddenly reversing their previous strategy at the exact same time
as the football game, but anyway), cool but too late to do anything.
Tries to break out the underground cops, that didn’t work out, captured
and then freed by Batman who breaks them out more successfully - that’s
ok because he has a new mission leading an exodus over the bridge, but
that doesn’t work out either. I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing
that one of our main characters spends so much time running around not
accomplishing anything because viewed right that’s part of his
disenchantment. We see the final straw when the rigidity of the police
following orders on the other side dooms the bus full of orphans to
oblivion, but what happened to Blake in the Gotham anarchy that led to
that moment? Again, that would have made an interesting story - but
would have been at the expense of the one that was actually told.</p>

<div class="section" id="loose-thoughts">
<h2>Loose thoughts</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Object that has been most unnecessarily shaped into a bat: darts.
That has to make them less&nbsp;aerodynamic.</li>
<li>I <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1wolaRQrOEAqgpZoj1zMh33CkgSlR3gww7dmqkWAHuIc">wrote
something</a>
a few years ago on Gotham as anarchy and Batman relationship with its
institutions to describe different schools of realism, Joker section
is a bit forced but the rest still vaguely holds.</li>
<li>I swear there’s a line from Catwoman that’s lifted from the Halle
Berry movie, which I’m assuming is a little in-joke, or I made it up.</li>
<li>Also: does she, or anyone else, ever refer to her as Catwoman?</li>
<li>Speaking of in-jokes: killer crocs!</li>
<li>“Some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb!”</li>
<li>Be interesting if there's ever an extended cut - I'm generally of the
opinion the shorter cut is always the better film, but i'm curious to
know what was left on the cutting room floor.</li>
<li>Did his name have to literally be 'Robin'? It was pretty obvious what
was going on there even without that.</li>
<li>Cheap energy that dooms us all is starting to be a bit of a recurring
theme in superhero films: this, Spiderman II, Avengers, any others?</li>
<li>You know if they took down some of those doors, they could probably
make a walkway fairly easily.&nbsp;MacGyver&nbsp;wouldn't be stuck in there for
long is all I'm saying.</li>
</ul>
