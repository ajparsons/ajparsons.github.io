					<p>While Battlestar Galactica is seen as the sci-fi show that is most
clearly a&nbsp;thematic reaction to 9/11 and the 'post 9/11 world'
(complaints about how its <a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/10/in-which-your-host-gets-angry-and-other.html">ripped from the headlines
nature</a>
negate it's own ability to world-build notwithstanding), something I've
started to noticed is sci-fi shows using the imagery of 9/11 in a
distinctive way quite&nbsp;separated&nbsp;from delving into the events themselves.
&nbsp;One of most famous reveals in cinematic sci-fi is from The Planet of
the Apes, where Charton Heston finds the <a class="reference external" href="http://movieclips.com/Y72BL-planet-of-the-apes-movie-the-statue-of-liberty/">Statue of Liberty buried in
the
beach</a>
and realises this place that he thought was an alien wilderness is in
fact all too familiar. What’s cropping up in a few places now is the
World Trade Center working as the reverse of that, a reveal of a New
York landmark that shows you have left the familiar and entered a
strange, unsettling place.</p>
<p>In both Fringe and the US-remake of Life on Mars, the presence of the
World Trade Center serves this function, solidifying&nbsp;that characters
have entered a strange new world. In Life on Mars, Sam Tyler seeing the
intact WTC is the crown of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9GNi6tSmc">the accident
sequence</a>, finishing his
transition to the alien world of yesterday.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/a/Whqtx#0"><img alt="image0" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/fringeposter-300x82.png" /></a></p>
<p>A major feature of Fringe is the presence of an alternate universe that
is fundamentally <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjEMKVdSVc">both similar and different to our
own</a>. &nbsp;At the end of the
first season of Fringe, Olivia has travelled to meet the enigmatic
William Bell only to whisked away to somewhere else - the final shot of
the series revealing she has travelled to the other universe and to an
office in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_go1SU1oJ0&amp;t=2m00s">a still-standing alternate version of the World Trade
Center</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;While
the difference in the events of 9/11 are far from the only
feature&nbsp;separating&nbsp;the universes (there’s something interesting about
growing numbers of alternate universes with zeppelins but anyway) it’s
used as a continuing touchstone for stories involving the other
universe; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvw2L6BKv6k&amp;feature=related">the repeated use of the NY
skyline</a>,
an architect from ‘Other There’ caught in a fringe event was designing
the New Pentagon, Peter’s visit to a possible future has him arriving at
the base of a completed Freedom Tower, the ‘amber-blue’ Lincoln Lee on
crossing over for the first time&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;think the other universe seems
that different until he gets his first look at the twin towers - showing
him even though the place is superficially familiar it is deeply alien.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths.png"><img alt="image1" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths-300x85.png" /></a></p>
<p>With their shape they invoke another icon of classic sci-fi: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y15NnGZIBuM">the
monolith</a>.&nbsp;When I first
thought about this I dismissed it as&nbsp;a bit of a trite comparison between
two things that happen to be cuboids - but the way they're used is
actually quite similar; they're deployed as a symbol of strangeness
beyond understanding, something that&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;possibly exist and yet
does.</p>
<p>That the past is many ways a different planet is part of the fundamental
conceit of Life on Mars and for all the discussion of whether 9/11
really did &quot;change everything&quot;, it's interesting to see how quickly it's
entered&nbsp;the sci-fi repertoire as&nbsp;part of how we describe
an&nbsp;utterly&nbsp;alien world.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/447138298-300x161.jpg" />(This post contains spoilers. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slashfilm.com/spoilers-good-study/">But spoilers are good for
you</a>.)</p>
<p>The first installement of Charlie Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-mirror/">Black
Mirror</a> is, if
nothing else, clever.&nbsp;The name of the anthology&nbsp;itself is clever, being
both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&nbsp;indulge&nbsp;their darker selves. &nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&nbsp;massacre.&nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&quot;)&nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.</p>
<p>I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&nbsp;Chris Applegate <a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp">points
out</a> the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf">Guardian Screen Burn
column</a>&nbsp;(
p191)&nbsp;in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.</p>
</div><div><p>The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div><p>This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.</p>
<p>In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.</p>
<p>UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html">used on the BBC
website</a>).&nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&nbsp;that their&nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.</p>
</div><div><p>That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media">in promotion of Black
Mirror</a>:</p>
</div>

    <div>

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

    <div>

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div><p>But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&nbsp;A&nbsp;longer&nbsp;stretch&nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:</p>

<div><p>What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&nbsp;In this sense it's a&nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.</p>
<p>Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&quot;</p>
<p>You pay the licence fee, you decide.</p>

					<p>“It's like when we used to let kings take over from their fathers:
that's the craziest rule that ever existed. If the king dies they let
his kid be the king - what are the odds that he's not going to be a
piece of shit? That's one of the weirdest things that we've ever done as
a race of people.” &nbsp;- Louis C.K.</p>
<p>I’ll confess I wasn’t that excited when it was announced they’re finally
getting round to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544">ending male primogeniture for the
monarchy</a>. While it’s good in
principle in the sense that it’s absurd and sexist to say that a
second-born son is going to be a better ruler than a first-born
daughter, it’s also a bit absurd to say the first-born is inherently
going to be better at the job than the second-born. After a bit more
thought though, I realised that if you look at it from the other
direction (who it keeps off the throne) it actually makes a lot of sense
as a method of reducing violent&nbsp;political&nbsp;conflict.</p>
<p>If we imagine a different situation where an out-going king chose one of
their children on the basis of temperament and competency, this would
for many years introduce uncertainty about who the next king would be.
Uncertainty raises the potential power of factions as they angle behind
various contenders which in turn increases the probability of violence.
By introducing criteria for a ‘good king’ it would also make it more
likely that outsiders would try to make a case that they
better&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;the criteria than any of the heirs on offer, which again,
increases the likelihood of violence. Always sticking with the
first-born means you don't have to judge on any other criteria, and the
order of&nbsp;succession&nbsp;will change as few times as possible[1. To bring
this back to male primogeniture, because swapping heirs from a girl to a
boy increases the number of order changes, on the face of it it's a bad
thing - but if the fundamental concern is stability and there's a
substantial faction that would back a male heir over a female heir
anyway, there's nothing to be gained by a system
that&nbsp;legitimized&nbsp;another potential faction.].&nbsp;So looking at it this way
it isn’t about selecting the right ruler, it’s about establishing norms
that disqualify everyone else. Lots of people can raise an army but
almost no one is the first-born son of the king.</p>
<p>All this was going through my head about about the same time as I was
reading the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books, which was convenient because
Martin spends an a lot of time dwelling on the problems of succession.
While the series is often quite <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/18/realpolitik_in_a_fantasy_world">politically
interesting</a>&nbsp;what
I hadn’t noticed straight-off is how methodical he is at taking apart
and examining the problem of what makes a monarch legitimate - each of
the various Kings that end up fighting over the Iron Throne in <em>Game of
Thrones</em> and <em>Clash of Kings</em> are operating on different principles of
legitimation. Because Robert and Ned have overthrown Aeron the norms
governing succession have broken down and the stage is set for people
who would ordinarily be disqualified to make a play for the throne.
Given Joffrey is illegitimate, Stannis’ claim as the younger brother of
ex-King Robert is fairly straight-forward but there is no way for Renly
to trace a claim that doesn’t involve going through Stannis first.
Instead Renly bases his claim on a charismatic populism, not that he is
the rightful heir but that he would be a better and more popular king
than everyone else is on offer. Elsewhere Robb Stark is effectively
making the case for a right of national self-determination for the
North, Joffrey’s claim is mostly already being on the throne (there’s a
lot to be said for institutional inertia) and when the Greyjoys start
making trouble, they claim their lands by right of conquest - something
that lurks in the background of everyone else’s claims is their ability
to enforce them (the throne they’re competing over is literally made of
swords after all).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all of these are incompatible (there’s no
particular reason why Renly’s populism needs to clash with Robb’s
national self-determination) but between them all they lack a common
denominator to settle the issue other than endless bloody war, that’s
exactly what happened. While saying primogeniture results in peace would
clearly be an overstatement, it definitely has its upside. It’s also
inherently unstable because of the original problem that, just as it
doesn’t have a mechanism for selecting the most fit king, it also
doesn’t have a method of weeding out unfit ones either - for each
generation debilitating mental illness is a roll of the dice, as is the
possibility that the new monarch might just be such an awful person that
they threaten the system. It’s not wonderful, but part of what makes
Westeros such a depressing place is that sometimes it might just be as
good as you're going to get.</p>

<div><p><strong>|image0|****Assorted 'Let’s Kill Hitler' thoughts:****</strong></p>
</div><div><ul class="simple">
<li>The one thing you can say about Moffat stories is that they are
bursting with ideas, sometimes they don’t mesh well (a problem I have
with the Library two-parter) but when it works the show is just alive
with creative energy. This week we had: many, many details of River
Song’s increasingly temporally confused backstory - the crew of the
Enterprise manning the T-1000 with polite and deadly robot jellyfish,
travelling through time, setting right what once went wrong with
horrible horrible torture - &nbsp;a mysterious religious order devoted to
answering the final question and ending the universe - &nbsp;extractor
fans! This had it all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.abyssandapex.com/200710-wikihistory.html">Everyone kills Hitler on their first
trip</a>.</li>
<li>Clearly the crew of the Justice Vehicle are pretty awful people. Most
stories about time travellers who try to kill Hitler give them a
motive of trying to prevent the wrongs of the past (and then learn
important lessons about knock-on effects), the ‘travel to the very
last moment of their life and torture them’ approach is more
respectful of the timeline but also more morally reprehensible. It
has no deterrent effect, in fact it’s vital no one knows about them
because telling people about it would effect the timeline - what it
comes down to is people in the far future judging your life according
to criteria you’re not aware of and punishing you in a way that’s
really only to the benefit of their bloodlust. Hitler I imagine we
can all agree belongs on the shit list, but if Churchill (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html">not
universally a wonderful
person</a>)
had a visitor to his deathbed people might be more split.</li>
<li>Time travellers creating an afterlife because God let us down by not
existing is also dipped into briefly in the Baxter and Clarke novel
‘<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days">The Light of Other
Days</a>’,
where towards the end the perfection of time-traversing wormholes
allows the far future to download and recreate the brain at the
moment of death. Sufficiently advanced technology indeed.</li>
<li>Questions that cause the universe to end have a good pedigree. While
the obvious association of an ultimate question given Adams’ Who
connection is to Hitchhikers, what this made me think more of more
are two classic short stories, Clarke’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html">The Nine Billion Names of
God</a>’
and Asimov’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last
Question</a>’. In ‘The
Nine Billion’ a computer is built to systematically list all the
possible names of God in the belief that when this happens the
purpose of the universe will be fulfilled and it will promptly shut
up shop - the final question is answered and silence will fall
(coincidentally, the stars going out now qualifies as a recurring
thing in New Who). In ‘The Last Question’ successive generations from
the near-present to the heat-death ask a question of the increasingly
sophisticated machines they’ve created, a question that’s at first an
intellectual curiosity and then gradually the last and only relevant
question: “Can entropy be reversed?”. While interesting I don’t think
this is any use for plot guessing purposes, I’m just hoping for
something better than “Doctor Who?” (Although there would be
something very Adamish in an inter-temporal war and attempted
universe-cide resulting from a very badly misunderstood knock knock
joke.)</li>
<li>As Mels grows up alongside with her parents, Moffat seems to be
pushing the idea that effectively they did raise her anyway and so
this solves the problem of how the show can tonally have Amy and Rory
having adventures not related to getting their stolen child back. I’m
willing to accept this-ish,but clearly Rory and Amy would be better
parents to a child now then they would have been when they themselves
were children. Given Mels seems to have a slightly rocky life and
most of what they know about River’s later life is that she’s
imprisoned in the Stormcage (which really in terms of actually
keeping people in is almost as bad as Arkham), it’d be easy for them
to imagine that Melody would have had a much better life if they’d
properly had the chance to raise her. It's a bit of a serious downer
and I’m curious to see if the show has any further interest in
addressing it.</li>
<li>Is the Doctor just dressing to go out in style, or does the outfit
change signify like in ‘Flesh and Stone’ that there’s a bit of story
missing that might appear later on? As ever, there is insufficient
data for a meaningful answer.</li>
