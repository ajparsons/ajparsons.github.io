					<p>(This post contains spoilers - if you’re planning to play probably don’t
read? But you can if you want. I'm not your dad or
anything.)</p>
<p>In Gone Home, only one thing really happens. You read letters, you put
tapes into cassette players, gain access to parts of the house initially
locked off, but there is only one action you take that causes the world
to change irrevocably (and while effective, it’s a bit of a cheat
really). I think this more than anything gives a feel for the kind of
game this is, one based around reflective discovery rather than action.
The world is interactive, but only really transforms in the sense that
your understanding of it changes.</p>
<p>But let’s backtrack and set the scene: It’s a dark and stormy night in
1995, player character Katie has been travelling round Europe and has
now returned home - only her family has moved and now the family house
is a place she’s never been, a house where they never finished
unpacking, where items from different eras and lives lie alongside each
other. A house where no one’s home.</p>
<p>You make your way through the house, gradually turn on the lights and
encounter the artifacts of your family’s life while you were away. As
the game progresses, three different but interconnected stories become
apparent:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Young love blooming - the story of younger sister Sam falling in love
and discovering her sexual identity - told explicitly at the player
through voiceover.</li>
<li>Marriage on the rocks - All has not been well for Katie’s parents
while she’s been away, their professional lives are on different
tracks and personally they’re drifting apart - learned through
correspondence with third parties scattered through the house.</li>
<li>Buried family history - Katie’s father Terrance was abused by his
uncle Oscar in this house -&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better">&nbsp;discoverable only from inference from
the artifacts around the
house</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thread is arguably the main story, the game ‘finishes’
(credits roll but you can still return to the house) when this story
reaches it’s end but what’s neat is it’s actually possible to get right
through the game without getting much of the third story at all. It
takes a lot of self-confidence to essentially hide so much of a story
that feeds into it’s other threads - making discovery of that story an
internal experience for the player - ‘show, don’t tell’ taken to an
extreme.</p>
<p>The most prominent way the story is told is through the voice-over of
extracts from Sam's journal - which in the initial entry we're told she
is using as a substitute for her normal conversations with Katie and so
is structured as a series of letters to the player character. The
distinction between player and character in the game has been most
looked at with the time the <a class="reference external" href="http://deadpixel.co/2013/08/not-gonna-happen/">character puts down and won't pick up
again</a> a diary entry
where Sam describes her first sexual experience with her girlfriend
(Katie’s ‘voice’ in the story is otherwise only really ‘heard’ through
the hover-over description she gives certain items) but to me the most
important distinction is the player is hearing these voice-overs,
contextualising objects with a history - Katie is not. Katie doesn't
come into possession of the letters until the last second of the game -
until that point the player has much more knowledge of what’s going on
than she does.</p>
<p>This actually also throws the diary entry into a different light -
without the voice-overs to guide us through the nascent relationship
Katie has a very different set of information to the player. She is
given a few visual hints that her sister is gay (a men's magazine in her
locker earns a 'oh my' label) and that there's a interestingly prominent
girl in her life, but this is I believe the first time Katie learns that
the relationship is romantic/sexual. We also have no idea exactly what
Katie's opinion of her sister's sexuality is. Katie is more
'conventional' than her sister - she actually answered the question on
her sex ed paper unlike Sam's (amazing) short story on the subject. The
player, eighteen years later on the far side of 'don't ask/don't tell'
(which is a period detail now!) and primed by hearing the story of young
love in Sam's own voice, might well be be feeling much more comfortable
with this than Katie is in that moment. We simply don't know. The player
character is going through an emotional journey at a very different rate
to the player and there's an interesting possibility of dissonance
there. Similarly in the final movement from cupboard under the stairs to
the attic, the player has been primed by the voiceover to expect
something very different to what Katie might be thinking - did you run?
Would Katie have?</p>
<p>As the genre demands the house is riddled with secret passages and
hidden doors (mostly justified, the passages all make sense as giving
servants access to certain parts of the house without crossing the main
spaces). As the story is essentially structured geographically,
staggering access to these passages allows for something open plan (a
house) to be re-funneled into a mostly linear story.&nbsp;This isn’t just
used as a structure convenience, creeping around these poorly lit
passages is used to put you in the world of the several different sets
of characters have also used these passages - creeping behind the
acceptable history and ideas of the family. Sam and her girlfriend use
the passages for privacy, but there’s also the inference that the
passage to the guest room is how uncle Oscar got his nephew from the
second floor down to the recesses off the basement undetected (to
reinforce this, an artifact of Oscar is found underneath the door frame
at the top of the passage, while an artifact of Terrance is found in the
cupboard at the end of the route in the basement- a path connected by
objects out of place).</p>
<p>Much has been written about how <a class="reference external" href="http://iam.benabraham.net/2013/08/gone-home-jump-scares-and-ludonarative-harmony/">Gone Home plays with and subverts
horror
tropes</a>
- there’s the light-bulb that coincidently breaks the moment the player
examines a creepy object (the ‘one action’ I’m talking about in the
first paragraph) but there’s also the the blood-stained bath with the...
oh, hair dye bottle next to it. One particular way the game mixes mood
and game design to create a storytelling moment is so simple it’s
genius. Coming out of the basement there’s a staircase with a pipe
running along the ceiling, as you move up the stairs the way a section
of the pipe breaks against the light at the top of the stairs gives the
illusion (as the shape of the section cutting off the light changes) of
a figure moving at the top. So far, so creepy - but this staircase is
along that path from guest bedroom to basement and once you've got the
idea of a shadowy figure moving up those stairs your brain is engaged
(even after you realise it’s just a pipe) and you might wonder why, if
there was one, a shadowy figure might be taking that particular route -
a clue to help you twig aspects of the Oscar story. Possible I'm
over-reading into that, but the possibility of story-telling through
optical illusion is a nifty thing.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting little meta-commentary about the game’s use of
horror game conventions in the change in Terrance’s novels over time. In
the basement there’s a note from Terrance’s father, an english lit
scholar commending him on publication of his sci-fi novel but commenting
harshly that the book is bound by cliché and genre conventions - a
phrase from this letter &quot;You can do better&quot; is recreated on big sheets
of paper in the office (you discover these in the opposite order,
transforming the faintly pathetic mantra into a deeply depressing one as
you find the source).</p>
<p>By the end of the story Terrance’s confidence has been revitalised and
he has after twenty years completed another novel in his time-travel
series- described as more introspective (where the hero doesn't save the
President's life but his own!) - trying to finally live up to his dad's
instruction to complete himself as an artist by turning inward, but in a
way that rejects the idea that it is the genre conventions that were
holding him back. I see this as a comment on ‘Gone Home’ itself and the
idea that video games can only become ‘art’ if they ditch the
conventions of their more populist output. The game does neat things in
part because the world it creates is so aware of genre expectations and
sees their inclusion (and subversion) as a way to deepen the experience
it creates. An introspective novel with a time machine.</p>

                </h2>
				Oct 28, 2012
                
				
					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/TWD-game-cover-286x300.jpg" />I've been a fan of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/">Telltale</a> since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Lw312RrXk">Sam &amp;
Max</a> games and in recent
games started to notice a trend towards games that had some
consideration of ethical issues. In their <em>Jurassic Park</em> game
characters have a lengthy debate about the morality of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency">lysine
contingency</a>,
and in their <em>Back to the Future</em> game a version of Emmett Brown
pointedly asks what gives you (Marty) the right to use time travel to
decide which people should and shouldn't be living happy lives in 1985.
While I ended up being disappointed by the game&nbsp;ending in both cases, I
was impressed at how Telltale had found ways to mine&nbsp;the world of
the&nbsp;franchises they're playing in&nbsp;and ask interesting ethical questions
about them. While the show version of <em>The Walking Dead</em> has issues, I
was interested to see what Telltale would do with a world that was
essentially always about making difficult ethical choices.</p>
<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> game exists in roughly the same world as the comics
and TV show&nbsp;(not aware if it's considered in the same canon as either,
although there is some character overlap) where the world is overrun by
a zombie&nbsp;apocalypse and the driving narrative force is dealing with&nbsp;how
people exist with uncomfortable decisions and the end of
civilisation.&nbsp;Gameplay is relatively simple, the majority of the game is
spent going between cut-scenes and dialogue options, where&nbsp;your choices
of dialogue will affect your relationship with other characters,
affecting future dialogue.&nbsp;There are also scenes where there is freedom
to roam and accomplish traditional point-and-click game tasks, or&nbsp;action
sequences with Quick Time events.</p>
<p>At the start of each episode the game tells you: '<em>This game series
adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.'</em>
However what becomes apparent quite quickly is that your ability to make
choices that drastically affect the story is quite limited but what I
found especially interesting after playing the first few episodes was
how this made the game better at being an 'ethics game' than an
endlessly branching story might be.</p>
<p>To take a typical choice, there's a situation where you can choose to
act morally, but this will cause you to have less time to gather
supplies. However aside from some dialogue about this the supplies
themselves mean nothing, this isn't a game with health bars and you are
physically able to carry out the same tasks no matter how much your
character has eaten.&nbsp;Similarly a decision whether or not to take
supplies from a possible abandoned car doesn't matter, your group will
survive and be alive and well in the next episode anyway.</p>
<p>To an extent this is making lives easier for the developers who don't
have to track and script every possible divergent fork.&nbsp;Unlike some text
adventure games it won't severely punish you hours down the line from a
decision made early on (and most decisions that cause divergent paths
collapse to the same outcome, if through slightly different means), all
death events are caused by&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;button mashing and there are
very few places where you can through dialogue choices lead to a 'game
over'. However, practical&nbsp;considerations&nbsp;aren't the only ones here and I
think the general inflexibility of the game world goes&nbsp;some way&nbsp;towards
making this an interestingly ethics-based game.</p>
<p>In trying to work out how to account for ethical choices in a game like
this I was reminded of a season two episode of <em>Angel</em> -
'<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(Angel)">Epiphany</a>'. In
this episode&nbsp;Angel, who had seen himself as a pivotal player in the
battle between good and evil, realises what a small player he really is
and decides that if the big ends are unchangeable then how he chooses to
act is the only thing that matters -&nbsp;&quot;If nothing we do matters, then all
that matters is what we do&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a credo that carries over well to The Walking Dead.&nbsp;Your
character simply does not have the power to influence the world around
him to huge degrees. We, as players, know that the world is on rails and
certain events are inevitable regardless of our choices but the
reactions of other characters are flexible enough to our choices that
there is a sense of immersion and weight to choices we make. &nbsp;The key
question here is if your character is powerless to prevent or control
his fate, does it make choosing to behave ethically more or less
meaningful?</p>
<p>My thinking is that this lack of control takes away a lot of traditional
gaming thinking from the player. If it was possible to prevent every
death, there'd be incentive for people to see each death as a failure
and constantly reload in search of that '100% complete' achievement (à
la&nbsp;<em>Heavy Rain</em>).&nbsp;By keeping choices about choosing sides (and
aligning yourself with various other characters), the game sidesteps the
problem of creating right and wrong answers to puzzles - there are
simply choices you make. And if these choices have no effect on 'game
score' - then there is no disincentive to role play.</p>
<p>How do you decide which four out of ten people will get food?&nbsp;You can
play it by who you want to keep 'on side' but as established that
doesn't matter-matter &nbsp;- by taking away practical gaming considerations
the game makes you consider what you would do in those circumstances.
&nbsp;When the game offered me a choice of keeping the last piece of food for
myself, I&nbsp;was stuck on that decision for a minute or so - without
in-game&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;our own sense of ethics can be fully engaged.</p>
<p>However, the flip side is the question of can a game that doesn't make
you suffer for picking morally better
but&nbsp;practically&nbsp;disadvantageous&nbsp;decisions really be asking you to make
meaningful decisions?&nbsp;To which I'd answer that meaningful in the game
and meaningful to the player are quite different things.&nbsp;By turning off
gamer logic, the game changes the basis you make decisions on. You're
not choosing which version of the game you want to be playing an hour
down the line but are forced to make decisions based on personal
considerations.</p>
<p>So while <em>The Walking Dead</em> may in some senses be far more linear than
it's described as, the linear plot creates room for an interesting kind
of sandbox ethics game. Even if most choices don't matter to the story,
they do matter to you.</p>
<p>(Interesting but unrelated:
