post</a>
explored, my reading of the Browne report is that they found it's the
responsibility of the state to ensure a decent level of funding for
education but also that the government decision making process can't be
trusted to carry this out -&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;a system in which money is
compelled out of the government coffers as loans, with prices set
elsewhere. The Browne report redefines the role of the state so that
there is no splitting of the burden between public and private sources,
but the state simply&nbsp;provides&nbsp; the capital upfront to allow your future
private self to fund your education. In this way it changes government's
role from being the representation of the public interest to one where
it plays banker and is no longer required to make funding decisions.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this in a few courses that are deemed to require
continued public funding. While the courses listed are discussed only in
terms of economic worth, keeping any idea of a cultural benefit firmly
out of range, what the report’s actually getting at here isn’t just
which courses are and aren’t economically required but mostly that these
are courses that are more expensive to run, and so require subsidies to
hide the true cost from students who might be put off. This amounts to
an acknowledgement of the fairly obvious reality that students will be
put off from one course as opposed to another on the basis of price
(even when the cost isn't paid upfront) and concludes that the
intimidation of higher fees for economically vital professions is
considered serious enough that intervention is required. But to play the
free-market position for a moment (and indeed use the language used
elsewhere in the report), surely if these professions are truly vital,
their future employers will pay higher wages that justify the investment
they make in an education? If student choice has failed us here, are
there other instances we should correct for the market?</p>
<p>Interestingly this means the Browne report does have a notion of the
public good, but only in so far as we have enough engineers - there is
no such argument made, for instance, that there is a good in having our
elite institutions truly open to all. [1. I agree with Paul Sager that
if we’re looking at elite institutions as a way for the poor to leapfrog
into the higher echelons of society this <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2010/11/19/tuition-fees-social-justice-and-social-mobility/">isn’t the best conception of
the overall
problem</a>,
but that said a system in which the existing elite completely dominate
the institutions that perpetuate it is even more undesirable than one in
which that’s only partly true.] &nbsp;Browne at the same time as basing its
system around the idea of student (consumer) choice, keeps pulling back
from the idea that students are actually capable of making the correct
decisions – and to be honest they’re probably right to - it’s not at all
clear that even given ridiculous amounts of metrics prospective students
will be in any position to make educated choices, as laid out in Stefan
Collini’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble">excellent critique of
Browne</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Browne appears to believe that the only relevant measure of teaching
quality is ‘student satisfaction’. That is how the system will work:
if they are satisfied, they’ll pay, and if not, not; and the
pressure they exert thereby will ‘drive up quality’. But this, other
problems aside, comes perilously close to reducing important human
experiences to a set of ‘preferences’ as reported on a tick-box
questionnaire. I would hope the students I teach come away with
certain kinds of dissatisfaction (including with themselves: a
‘satisfied’ student is nigh-on ineducable), and it matters more that
they carry on wondering about the source of that dissatisfaction
than whether they ‘liked’ the course or not. This is another respect
in which the ‘consumer’ model is simply misleading, an error
encouraged by the prevalence in current edspeak of the category of
‘the student experience’ (many universities now have a senior figure
entitled Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Student Experience). It may be that
the most appropriate way to decide whether the atmosphere in the
student bar is right is by what students say when asked in a
questionnaire whether they ‘like’ it or not. But this is obviously
not the best way to decide whether a philosophy degree should have a
compulsory course on Kant. The philosophy department might hope
that, some time after graduation, most of its former students would
come to see the wisdom of this requirement, but ‘student
satisfaction’ is not what is at issue here. That this recognition is
retrospective tells us something important about education:
individuals often need to be told by someone who knows that a
particular line of study is worth pursuing whether at the time they
want to or not.</blockquote>
<p>While the report writers attempted to solve the perceived inability of
politicians to make the right call on education by turning that decision
over to a market, it’s not at all clear that the mechanism they picked
is appropriate to the task and the report itself doesn’t have a great
deal of trust in prospective students to make the right decisions when
it’s really important. The vaguely tragic thing about the Browne report
is that the version that arrived in the final coalition plan doesn’t
even seem to achieve its own ends. Its goal of separating education
funding from government oversight has failed as the caps mean that many
universities will raise their fees to the cap just to replace cuts and
so future governments will be required to either raise the cap or
increase public investment in order to inject more money into the
system. I don’t think it’s a universally terrible plan, the repayment
plan is genuinely more progressive but it’s not at all convincing that
the fees based market approach gives enough benefits to justify the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/18/ipsos-mori-poll-tuition-fees-cuts">discouraging
effects</a>
that putting the price upfront &nbsp;produces.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401&#64;N07/5474761220/"><img alt="Money and Calculator" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5474761220_345e33882e.jpg" /></a><em>Note: I started writing this piece back in
January, the recent (and completely predictable) announcements that
everyone who can get away with it will be charging the maximum spurred
me to go back and finish it off.</em></p>
<p>I saw Aaron Porter on the 10 o’clock the other week (note: now many,
many months ago) criticising fees and loans on the basis that it will
put students into debt for decades, which coming from the NUS position
of a graduate tax is a little unfair as there is no practical difference
between repaying a loan for three decades and being subject to an
additional tax for the same amount of time (especially if both the tax
and repayments are structured in a progressive way). If we imagine a
situation where universities charged an infinite fee, an infinite loan
was given and repayments were structured progressively and had a sunset
after a few decades, there is no difference whatsoever in the effect on
the payee. There is however a psychological difference between a debt
with an exact price attached and a fuzzy commitment to higher taxes
that’s given too short a shrift in the report. Given the choice, giving
people good news (free university!) with hidden bad news (new higher
tax!) is better than giving bad news with hidden good news (Expensive
university! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14111421">Which you might not have to pay all
of!</a> And the repayments
process is good! But the frogurt is also cursed etc) and efforts to
reassure people that university is actually pretty affordable have to
fight uphill against that basic gut reaction, no matter how nice the
numbers look.</p>
<p>Because of that problem you’d hope that fees-and-loans had some pretty
substantial advantages over a graduate tax, but the Report’s criticisms
of it are quite revealing of what it’s actually trying to do. There are
a few areas where fees-and-loans is cleaner than a graduate tax would be
e.g. a graduate tax has issues reclaiming money from graduates who move
abroad and in dealing with students who&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;complete their courses
(not deriving enough benefit from their courses to justify a tax but
still a drain on the education budget), but the big issue Browne finds
with it is that it’s economically&nbsp;unfeasible&nbsp;given that it won’t start
to produce enough money to fund itself until 2041. This nicely overlooks
that fees-and-loans also requires the government to borrow/spend a large
amount of money year on year to be able to give loans to students and
the average student won’t start come close to paying back the original
amount until around the same time period. &nbsp;[update: &nbsp;the difference here
is a quirk of government accounting where loans only need to be
accounted for at the rate of non-repayment (RAB rate) - the actual lost
money over the long term - whereas spending money resulting from a tax
requires the full education budget to fit on the government coffers].
&nbsp;In both systems investment is not paid back for around 30 years – and
in the meantime the money still has to come from somewhere. I think what
the report’s criticism of a graduate tax is really getting at is the
notion that runs right through the report that government has
historically failed to make the investments necessary and cannot be
trusted to provide the general investment or per student funding the
system needs.</p>
<p>As I read it, the unwritten purpose throughout the report is to
safeguard university funding from future government action under the
(perhaps not unreasonable) assumption this government or likely future
governments will not substantially increase the amount of money going
into education through the block grant to universities, especially under
the current austerity plans. It takes the approach of rather than
arguing for increased public investment in further education, assume
that that’s a lost cause and try to find ways to do it without
government needing to be involved. By transforming all government
spending on further education into a guarantee of providing loans and
letting universities set the fees (with no caps) this gives universities
a semi-blank check from the government coffers to invest in themselves.
This I suspect is the serious objection of the Browne Report to a
graduate tax, despite shifting the cost onto graduates as a group it
leaves the funding decisions to government. With Fees-and-Loans that
year on year spending is hidden and occurs automatically behind the
loans, no actual decision is required to fund it. it’s hard to see any
government challenging the idea of deferred payment and it’s far easier
for fees-and-loans to hide behind this than a graduate tax.</p>
<p>However the problem here is that giving universities a blank cheque is a
really bad idea because in the unlikely, “why would that ever happen?”
event that lots of universities change high fees (ironically as Stephen
Tall <a class="reference external" href="http://iaindale.com/posts/why-the-coalition-is-muddled-but-right-about-tuition-fees">points
out</a>,
this might not have happened without fee caps), the government is then
on the hook for more than it’s really able to be and we end up with the
situation where they’re desperately looking to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/node/18897863?story_id=18897863&amp;fsrc=rss">offload some of the debt
load onto the private
sector</a>.
As the next post will go into, at the same time as a market-based system
still runs into the money problem it’s also opened up a whole new can of
worms in terms of what a market in education is actually supposed to
function.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikileaks_logo.svg"><img alt="Wikileaks logo" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Wikileaks_logo.svg/120px-Wikileaks_logo.svg.png" /></a>One of the things I'm interesting in at the moment is
how through the internet we're seeing a form of activist emerge, looking
to change the world through fairly untraditional means. As some of the
most high profile and interesting examples, I'm going to look at
Wikileaks and Facebook.&nbsp;My starting point is the idea that both of these
are projects that attempt to utilize the power of technology to create
social change without the need for a large consensus in favour of that
change. Assange is much easier than Zuckerberg to examine in this
respect because he's quite publicly explored and written down exactly
what he believes and intends to accomplish and Wikileaks is quite
clearly conceived of as a way to achieve these ends (whereas while
Facebook is underpinned by various philosophies, I suspect it wasn't
conceived of as a means to an end in quite the same way).</p>
<p>Aaron Bady has a fantastic exploration of his
ideas&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/">here</a>,
but as he says
Assange's&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf">original</a>&nbsp;is
quite readable. His basic premise is that most governments and
organisations can be understood as conspiracies (with an explicit
parallel to how terrorist networks have been modelled) that will create
ways to communicate in secret. Having an environment where secrets can
be kept makes it more likely that things that need to keep secret will
occur (typically bad things) and so we want methods of destroying these
conspiracies. The traditional method of destroying important nodes (e.g.
assassination of key figures) is not always hugely effective if the
network can route round them (plus it's frowned upon in politic society)
so Assange focuses on how the links between conspirators can be
disrupted to erode and reduce the 'total conspiratorial power' of the
network. While that essay doesn't look at the idea of leaks
specifically, Wikileaks quite clearly fits neatly into that role.</p>
<p>It's helpful to look at this through a specific example, so let's think
about how 'cablegate' fits in. It's a nice point of irony the reason why
this leak was possible at all was the realisation in the US intelligence
community of the issue that more secure communication is not always the
most effective communication, one of the conclusion that came out of the
9/11 commission was that a fair amount of useful information existed but
was being kept in closed silos by various different agencies and that a
system that sharing information needed to be used more. This led
to&nbsp;massive expansion in the use of SIPRNet to the point it's now
accessible in a large amount of embassies and US military bases, and
while we can't say how many people have physical access to the system in
1993 at least&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/28/siprnet-america-stores-secret-cables">three
million</a>&nbsp;had
the 'secret' clearance that would have given them the right to view it
and there's no particular reason to think that's decreased by a huge
degree ( for scale, that's around 1% of the current US population). The
electronic nature means that it's possible to steal what would once have
been a warehouse of data out in something that fits in your pocket and
while there are also safeguards in place to detect and prevent people
doing exactly what Manning is accused of doing, there are suggestions
that this was turned off as it was inconvenient for people using the
system (The problem in microcosm: greater secrecy again getting in the
way of an efficient system.)</p>
<p>The interesting bit of Assange's thinking is not the familiar trade-off
between convenience/openness and secrecy/security but how he intends to
use that to get the conspiracy to destroy itself. He argues that a
conspiracy that's communication is compromised will lock down further,
reducing its own ability to organise and conspire that will ultimately
lead to it either losing the ability to function at all or reduce its
ability to fight off outside threats. As Bady put it:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead, he is trying to strangle the links that make the conspiracy
possible, to expose the necessary porousness of the American state's
conspiratorial network in hopes that the security state will then
try to shrink its computational network in response, thereby making
itself dumber and slower and smaller.</blockquote>
<p>This endgame and the focus on making the links between conspirators
untrusted explains why these leaks are of a different character to how
we'd normally expect leaks to look. Typically leaks are things
considered by the leaker to be evidence of crimes, bad practice, etc but
in this case while there have been a few juicy tidbits the vast majority
of the leaks are quite boring because for this strategy the content of
the leaks is almost unimportant as it's their very existence that
reduces the trust of the conspirators and makes them turn on the
system[2. The other side of this is that releasing boring information
shows how much information is pointlessly marked secret and can be seen
as part of the argument in favour of more open government, all of us
linked to all of us has greater ‘computational power’ in Assange’s
language and releasing information more freely increases the prospects
of it being combined with other useful information to result better
analysis of that information. This is a view of government openness
framed in terms of efficiency rather than public interest that can be
picked up in a lot in techie discussion on the subject and I might see
if I can explore further in a future post.].</p>
<p>In this case, we can probably expect to see the network close down, by
enforcing the security procedures that already exist or having better
division of access so that people on military bases in Iraq don't have
access to the entire sum of secret knowledge but the interesting
question is if the diplomats will trust any such system or if in future
they'll be more guarded in what they write and just rely on informal
communication for anything they don't want to write down.</p>
<p>This reliance on informal methods will indeed make it dumber, slower and
less able to function – but will it shut down altogether? I suspect not,
the modern state can survive an enormous amount of inefficiency
and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/22/the_us_is_too_secure_for_its_own_good">Stephen Walt's
argument</a>&nbsp;that
through America's overwhelming global dominance its decision making
processes are insulated from even large screw-ups applies here. US
global hegemony and its state's secrecy culture can survive a lesser
functioning diplomatic corp. and there are no real existential threats
on the institution. The 'convince the snake to eat itself' strategy can
only be effective in organisations where there is very small difference
between 'status quo' and 'complete institutional collapse', which I
don't think is the case in a lot of these organisations.</p>
<p>We can see other examples of this in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338038">'postit'
culture</a>&nbsp;it's been suggested has
risen within the British government after FOI came in, where rather than
leave controversial details in documents that may someday be subject to
FOI request (and even ones that won't) these are attached as post-it
notes to the documents, which can safely be discarded at the other end.
Less efficient maybe and terrible for future historians, but it is
unlikely to lead to internal collapse or leave it much more vulnerable
to outside threats. The institution is secure. Fundamentally Wikileaks
represents an attempt to create an institution that in turn creates
institutional change in other organisations. It doesn't seek to directly
destroy secretive norms of behaviour, it seeks to turn them in on
themselves and my thinking is that this will ultimately prove
ineffective as there are many lower levels of function the conspiracy
will be willing to accept.</p>
<p>To return to starting point what I'm trying to get at is that the
internet allows powerful institutions to exist without requiring much in
the way of social support. One man with a Lady Gaga CD can download the
entire backlog of diplomatic cables, and another group can deliver the
largest leak in history to the world. In terms of sheer power, the
internet is a great leveller but what Assange (and as we'll get to,
Zuckerberg) want is norm changes. Wikileaks has the power to disrupt
conspiracies directly by leaking damaging information on them but what
he really wants to able to do is remove the ability to conspire and
prevent future potential conspirators even wanting to – and I think this
a goal I'm&nbsp;skeptical&nbsp;can be accomplished in all cases through the clash
he describes and requires a view on how institutions can be reformed to
openness.</p>
