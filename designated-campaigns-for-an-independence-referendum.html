					<p>Something caught my eye in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Agreement-final-for-signing.pdf">draft section 30
order</a>
to empower the Scottish Parliament to pass&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;on
an&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum:</p>
<blockquote>
[4 (2)] In those provisions as applied by this article, references,
however expressed, to a person or body designated under section 108
[of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]&nbsp;are to be
read as references to a person or body designated under an Act of
the Scottish Parliament for the purposes of an independence
referendum as representing those campaigning for a particular
outcome in relation to the question in the referendum.</blockquote>
<p>This in interesting because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">section
108</a>&nbsp;gives
the power to appoint&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaigns (who gain
certain&nbsp;financial&nbsp;assistance, access to broadcast and freepost) to the
Electoral Commission - instead this is indicating the Scottish
Parliament will have the ability to directly&nbsp;designate&nbsp;campaigns for the
respective sides.&nbsp;As there's yet to be a case where there was serious
competition between two groups for the same designated status this seem
relatively&nbsp;harmless, although technically this would also allow one
campaign to be&nbsp;designated&nbsp;without the other (seems unlikely).&nbsp;The
Scottish Parliament could of course pass this back to the Electoral
Commission when they come to legislate.</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp;The memorandum of agreement seems to be stating that the
Electoral Commission should retain its role of 'designating lead
campaign organisations' which makes the above curious. I suspect in the
grand scheme of things it's doing absolutely nothing, but I'm just not
sure why it's there at all.</p>
<p>4.1 (a) in the s 30 order directly refers to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/127">s 127 of
PPERA</a>,
which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
A broadcaster shall not include in its broadcasting services any
referendum campaign broadcast made on behalf of any person or body
other than one designated in respect of the referendum in question
<strong>under section 108</strong>.</blockquote>
<div><p>&nbsp;And I'm wondering if 4.2 is then just being over&nbsp;cautious&nbsp;in relation
to this. If the Electoral Commission retains its designation powers,
those groups will be designated by s 108 and be counted under that
anyway. If that's the explanation, then 4.2 isn't needed at all and is
actually transferring more than they intended to the Scottish
Parliament, allowing it to designate extra groups that could make
election broadcasts and mailshots (not a hugely useful power but hey).</p>
