					<p>I've been listening to lots of interesting comments on the
Independence&nbsp;Referendum&nbsp;debate recently&nbsp;and thought it was probably
worth getting all my notes somewhere in a coherent form.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;shied&nbsp;away
from developments on the substance of independence or devolution towards
issues relating the process and form of the referendum itself (and the
post is large enough just focusing on those questions). The following is
based on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">an&nbsp;event at the Constitution
Unit</a>&nbsp;with
<a class="reference external" href="http://constitution-unit.com/2012/03/12/scottish-independence-referendum-should-be-lawful-fair-and-decisive/">Prof. Robert
Hazell</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan Trench</a>&nbsp;and two
panels before the Scottish Affairs Committee, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10452">one quizzing
academics</a>
(for the purposes of this post, Panel A) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">the other quizzing both
sides of the AV
campaign</a>
(Panel B).</p>
<p><em>Panel A:</em></p>
<div><p>Professor Vernon Bogdanor, Research Professor at Kingâ€™s College London</p>
</div><div><div><p>Professor John Curtice, Professor of Politics University of Strathclyde</p>
</div><div><p>Peter Kellner, President, YouGov</p>
</div></div><div><p>Professor Iain McLean, Official Fellow in Politics, Nuffield College,

Reform Society (ERS)</p>
</div><div><p>William&nbsp;Norton -&nbsp;Responsible Person for NOTOAV&nbsp;and referendum agent for
No campaign for NE Referendum 2004</p>
<p>Willie Sullivan - Head of Field Operations for yes to fairer votes,&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;director of Electoral Reform Society (ERS).</p>
</div><p>I've also included some brief comments from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=9307">the Electoral Commission
evidence</a>,
but for the most part the debate has changed enough to make much of that
session irrelevant.</p>
<div class="section" id="role-of-the-electoral-commission">
<h2><strong>Role of the Electoral Commission</strong></h2>
<p>The general consensus from Panels A &amp; B that the currently proposed
question is unfair, but Curtice points out that Electoral Commission
corrections haven't always been completely&nbsp;unobjectionable&nbsp;so wouldn't
go as far as to make the commission's comments on questions binding.
Along those lines&nbsp;Norton argued it'd be unnecessary as proceeding with
a&nbsp;question&nbsp;the Electoral Commission had labelled dodgy would be a gift
to the&nbsp;disadvantaged&nbsp;campaign anyway so sufficient political incentives
exist without mandating use of the electoral commission formulation.
&nbsp;Kellner made the case that the question doesn't actually make that much
difference, something interesting for a pollster to say as question
effects can have a large effect on how people answer. &nbsp;However I can see
there being a case for not applying polling logic to referenda as most
voters will be exposed to the campaigns long before the ballot and so
question-wording effects could be far less strong than in polling. &nbsp;He
argued what was far more important was that the question be&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;to
be fair, and the Electoral Commission role in this regard
is&nbsp;creating&nbsp;demonstrable&nbsp;justice rather than creating an unproblematic
question.</p>
<p>There was a general feeling in panel A however that in the event of
referendum where there might be other&nbsp;contentious&nbsp;structural issues
other than the question (such as the form of questions and counting
system to choose between three or more options) that the commission's
advisory role should be expanded to include those issues.&nbsp;In Panel B
there was opposition&nbsp;to the idea of the electoral commission producing
more material, with both sides pointing out they objected to the neutral
material during the AV campaign. Sullivan argued that it probably wasn't
cost-effective and the money might be better spent on more broadcasts -
which Elliot argued there should be more of, but shorter to fit in
better with how people understand adverts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-a-yes-no-format-matter">
<h2><strong>Does a 'yes/no' format matter?</strong></h2>
<p>The former Scottish First Minister Lord McConnell has suggested <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9141435/Lord-McConnell-Hold-referendum-on-straight-question-within-18-months.html">that
votes should select from
duelling&nbsp;statements</a>&nbsp;(i.e.
something like 'Scotland should be an independent country'', 'Scotland
should remain part of the UK'') rather than answering a yes/no question
to&nbsp;deprive the SNP of the advantage of running a 'yes' campaign, but
from the AV teams there wasn't an impression that this was hugely
important.&nbsp;Elliot argued that actually yes/no isn't hugely important (or
at least that slanting is variable on economic conditions and national
mood rather than an inherent bias either way) and the debate can still
be defined in those terms even if the question isn't, with the example
of how the 1997 Scottish referendum was covered by the media as a yes/no
campaign despite it a question of&nbsp;duelling&nbsp;statements. Sullivan thought
that the big difference was 'change/status quo' which exists however the
question is worded, and that the advantage will rest with&nbsp;the&nbsp;status
quo. The take away message here being that there probably isn't a lot of
point in trying to avoid a 'yes/no' question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-there-be-multiple-options">
<h2><strong>Should there be multiple options?</strong></h2>
<p>Kellner said it would be 'perverse' if some kind of devo-max wasn't an
option and as Bogdanor&nbsp;nicely put it &quot;it'd be very odd that an
instrument designed to discover what Scottish people think
should&nbsp;exclude&nbsp;the option that they most favour&quot;.&nbsp;Trench argued that
most Scots want around 65% change which is closer to independence than
not, so it could well in the unionist's interests to put forward a
devolution option and that the current Unionist pursuit of a 'jam
tomorrow' option where a No vote on&nbsp;independence&nbsp;would be rewarded with
further devolution could well run into a credibility problem&nbsp;as the
recommendations of Calman Commission have yet to pass into law - giving
a bad record for the UK government's ability to proactively manage
further devolution.</p>
<p>There's a related point that even if there's only one question on the
ballot, there's still a decent case to be made for having multiple
referendums on that single question.&nbsp;As it was unlikely
that&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;or consensus on indepedence or even agreement on
certain flavours of devolution could be reached before the vote
(although Kellner pointed out, a lot of it will become apparent within
the&nbsp;campaign)&nbsp;Panel A were quite keen on the need for two referendums,
one enabling&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;and another post-negotiations&nbsp;binding
referendum for agreement to terms and Trench <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scotland-may-need-two-referendums-and-process-is-flawed-expert-claims-1-2179480">similarly supports
this</a>.
In Panel B, Sullivan indicated that the ERS wasn't&nbsp;wholly supportive of
that (or at least, much less than their evidence would suggest).</p>
<p>Panel A raised concerns about the content of Devo-Max, mainly that it's
as yet ill-defined and needs to be more so before the referendum&nbsp;(the
arrival of devo-plus on the scene may or may not change this situation).
Bogdanor put forward that if it's an option it not only needs to be
defined but needs to be shown what is on offer is&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;an option
from Westminster. Noton pointed out that the North-East devolution,
welsh powers and AV referendums had outcomes that were well-known and
thought out before the election. He argues that it's fundamentally a
unionist proposal and it's up to the unionist side to define it (which
raises the question of who's actually for the status quo, but we'll get
to that in a bit). &nbsp;McLean again argued that it isn't realistic for all
the negotiations to happen ahead of time, hence the idea of a second
confirming referendum.</p>
<p>Ghose and Sullivan agreed that a three option referendum could probably
have three campaigns, which brings up the issue that the&nbsp;Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 &nbsp;(PPERA) has an&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">'all or
nothing'
rule</a>&nbsp;for
having a&nbsp;designated&nbsp;lead campaign, something that could be interesting
in a three-way referendum as it's not at all clear who the groups that
would argue for each option would be - you'd expect a common unionist
position to emerge and it's not clear if that would be devo-max or the
status quo. Depending on the exact details of a devolution option, there
might of course be a three-way split but in the event that this doesn't
happen it's not clear if any lead campaigns are allowed (Referendum
legislation could of course amend PPERA to allow a minimum of two).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-should-a-multi-question-referendum-be-conducted">
<h2><strong>How should a multi-question referendum be conducted?</strong></h2>
<p>In&nbsp;terms&nbsp;of precedent, the New Zealand electoral system&nbsp;referendum&nbsp;was
mentioned by Kelner, Sullivan and Hazell as an example of how a
multi-option referedum might be conducted.&nbsp;This is is one sense good
precedent being a multi-option referendum from a&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;style
parliamentary democracy, but as it's the&nbsp;example&nbsp;that comes up again and
again it does illustrate that this is relatively new ground and the door
is open for pretty much anything to happen here and
create&nbsp;precedent.&nbsp;Kellner also pointed out the 1997 Scottish devolution
referendum was effectively a three option vote, so it's not completely
without UK&nbsp;precedent, although in this case all three camps would
stronger options. Similarly Norton brought up the North East 2004
referendum as an example but also pointed out as the second question was
a&nbsp;subsidiary&nbsp;question, all campaigning focused on the first question.</p>
<p>The SNP's double question (the problems with which I went into
<a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">here</a>)
seems to have mostly gone away at this point and Panel A were divided on
the best way to go foward. Kellner has previously written something
helpful about the <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">five possible ways of doing
this</a>and
he and McLean both favoured a ballot that allowed people to rank '1' and
'2' which is then counted by the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
method</a>. In the
unlikely event of a Condorcet loop, McLean would want something in the
referendum legislation to deal with it and suggests defaulting to the
status quo. Bogdanor&nbsp;suggested a three option ballot with a later
run-off election and Curtice a gateway question approach, with the first
question giving a choice for&nbsp;independence and if that fails, question
two giving the choice between status quo and devo max.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS favours
a different gateway question, with the first being a question about
change in principle, the second then being a choice between the two
change options.</p>
<p>As Alan Reid called Sullivan on, the problem with the ERS question is it
only allows the status quo to a voter's first or last preference and
'Devo Max, status quo, independence' is a perfectly likely ordering (and
such a voter could end up empowering their least favoured option by
voting in accordance with their most) - a similar problem holds for
Curtice (it's the flaw of the gateway question in&nbsp;principle) but in this
case it's&nbsp;independence&nbsp;that can only be placed first or last, something
that's possibly more in key with actual preferences.&nbsp;McLean and Kellner
were opposed to runoffs and AV on the grounds that&nbsp;an option like Devo
Max could be the Condorcet winner and the consensus choice but if it
came third in the first round it'd be removed.&nbsp;Panel B very briefly
ventured onto this territory giving us the memorable moment of a former
member of the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign&nbsp;saying &nbsp;'it wouldn't work'
but alas they didn't go further into it.&nbsp;Trench questioned if you could
get a mandate from&nbsp;preferential&nbsp;voting, but this would presumably be
less of an issue with a run-off referendum.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="election-timing">
<h2><strong>Election Timing</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor argues that the referendum should happen sooner rather than
later as the issues aren't that complicated and the continued
uncertainty could be causing economic damage (a point he'd repeat from
the audience at the Con Unit). McLean argued in response that the
biggest economic issue is currency for&nbsp;Scotland's&nbsp;large financial
industry - and that this is an issue that could be addressed (and there
is incentive for both sides to do so) well before the referendum, making
timing less of an issue.</p>
<p>Hazell disagreed with Bogdanor that economic grounds were enough to
justify Westminster interference in picking a date, and argued
that&nbsp;there are two legitimate concerns for the UK&nbsp;government&nbsp;regarding
the time - avoiding a day that clashes with another election, and also
one that would come close to the next general election as this would
create <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/scottish-referendum-date-matters?">constitutional
awkwardness</a>
in the event of a vote for independence if a general
election&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;between the yes vote and independence - Scottish MPs
would be returned and potentially help form a&nbsp;government&nbsp;before
disappearing again.</p>
<p>This suggests that a date should be picked with regard to being able to
wrap up potential&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;before May 2015 - however the assumption
here is that the fixed parliament will last that long &nbsp;-&nbsp;over at the LSE
Politics and Policy blog Patrick Dunleavy is <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2012/02/20/general-election-2014-dunleavy/">not at all
convinced</a>
that the coalition will go the distance, expecting a dissolution and
Conservative and Labour agreement on an early election sometime in 2014
- in which case it's probably too late to avoid the problem above.
However this exact question and an ongoing referendum through 2014 might
actually either reinforce the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;or at least
create&nbsp;disincentives&nbsp;for Labour to agree to dissolve&nbsp;parliament (Keeping
Scotland in the union is strongly in the party's interest and may
deplete campaigning funds to an extent that they don't want to run a
general election the same year) and&nbsp;hence make the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;more likely
to run it's full course - so it's possibly everything cancels out here.</p>
<p>On a related time issue is the length of control period and the campaign
in general, which there was a general consensus in panel B that a longer
period was better and that the campaign needed at least twelve months.
&nbsp;Norton&nbsp;argued&nbsp;that 10 weeks control period simply wasn't enough time to
deal with the&nbsp;practicalities and time taken along the critical path to
the free post mailshots - in 2004 his campaign almost missed the
deadline and the NotoAV campaign this time around started printing
before they were&nbsp;officially&nbsp;the&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaign.&nbsp;The main problem
(that's probably&nbsp;unresolvable) with referenda as opposed
to&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament&nbsp;elections (and now&nbsp;possibly Westminster) is
there's no fixed time for the election to work towards and thereâ€™s an
incentive to do what the SNP are doing and have a long pre-legislation
period (still &nbsp;a year to go before that according to their timetable)
where campaign actions canâ€™t be monitored because
thereâ€™s&nbsp;officially&nbsp;nothing to campaign about going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="franchise">
<h2><strong>Franchise</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor thinks the voting age should be 16, but
that&nbsp;referenda&nbsp;shouldn't be special and the existing&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;should
apply. Curtice argues that changing the francise would be opening a can
of worms in terms of ideas about nationality and that&nbsp;&nbsp;it'd be
technically difficult to get people on the register anyway. Andrew
Scallan (Director of Electoral Administration at The Electoral
Commission)&nbsp;spent a long time not wanting to give a precise answer as to
how long the process of expanding the registers would take (more than
week, less than a year) but did suggest the best scenario would be
legislation in the summer followed by a household canvas in the
Autumn,&nbsp;but&nbsp;at other times of year the process might be more
difficult/result in a less complete register.</p>
<p>Interestingly as it's a local government francise EU citizens would be
able to vote but as typically they're bared from national elections
(which elections for a&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament would become in the event of
an independence win) means that they could effectively vote to remove
their own representation. Curtice points out however that they're
unlikely to vote at all so it's a bit of a moot point.</p>

<div class="section" id="status-of-rest-of-uk">
<h2><strong>Status of rest of UK</strong></h2>
<p>The role of the rest of the UK in this decision is&nbsp;variable&nbsp;on outcome,
Mclean argues that Scotland could declare independence&nbsp;unilateral&nbsp;but
could not declare devo max&nbsp;unilateral, as devolution would be a gift of
powers from Westminster. This distinction is less than it seems though
as the kind of independence that the SNP describes includes some quite
complex inter-dependence that would similarly require UK consent.&nbsp;Trench
said that a referendum on devo-max could include the rest of the UK &nbsp;(I
think I'd be correct in describing his view as falling far shorter than
'should'), Hazell was content that it could be negotiated by the
government. If the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;in general has been for referendums to
devolve powers, the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;is also that only the affected region
votes.</p>
