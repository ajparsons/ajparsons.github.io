					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Johannhari-150x150.jpg" />The Independent has finished it's investigation into the
Johann Hari saga and while&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html">Hari has
apologised</a>,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:</p>
<blockquote>
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.<strong>(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university</strong>.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&nbsp;seems to suggest that &quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&nbsp;acquainted - as <a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html">Jeremy Duns
points
out</a>,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.</p>
