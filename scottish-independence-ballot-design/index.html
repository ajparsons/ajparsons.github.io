<p>This is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-plan-to-take-charge-of-scottish-independence-vote-6260514.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.</p>
<p>Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &quot;independence lite&quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.</p>
<p>There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Kellner of YouGov has a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">good run
down</a>
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html">they're leaving a space open for it to
return</a>,
and ERS Scotland<a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases">is advocating a different
form</a> of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.</p>
<p>One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;independence?</p>
<p>One answer would be that the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.</p>
<p>There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&nbsp;information&nbsp;on if people would
prefer&nbsp;independence&nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.</p>
<p>If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Would you like a change to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Would you prefer&nbsp;independence or devo-max?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.</p>
<p>“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.</p>
<p>From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&nbsp;political&nbsp;stitch-up in&nbsp;Westminster).&nbsp;This leaves either&nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.</p>
