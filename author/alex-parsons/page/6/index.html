                </h2>
				Jul 23, 2012
                
				
					<p>(Spoilers, spoilers, this post contains spoilers).</p>
<p>Some quick assorted Dark Knight Rises thoughts. &nbsp;Looking back at some of
my previous posts like this, my usual opening writing tic is 'I liked
this film, but here's some things that were funny' - so in keeping with
that tradition I liked this film, but here's some things that were
funny.</p>
<div class="section" id="people-of-gotham">
<h2>People of Gotham</h2>
<p>I think the biggest critique possible of the film is that its most
thematically rich arena is the one most underused - the siege. &nbsp;To begin
with it's&nbsp;not clear why it's happening at all - the ticking timebomb
lends urgency to the final sequence, but why on earth is there that five
month delay? The real reason is that Bruce must be given realistic time
to overcome his physical and spiritual injuries and return to save the
day, but what’s the in-story explanation?</p>
<p>The obvious candidate is giving Gotham the chance to demonstrate it
doesn’t deserve to be saved (a reprise of the boats from the previous
film) - but this is undercut by the very little we see of Gotham’s
citizenry. It’s never really clear how much of Bane’s mob at the end is
imported or was recruited during the siege (it is implied that all along
it’s been fed by the unseen problems of the city though - ‘jobs in the
tunnels’ and all). We only have one character that buys into the
revolution and that’s Selina Kyle’s sidekick, the closest we have to a
class warrior is Selina Kyle herself, who quickly becomes disillusioned
at the results of Bane’s world (could be some fun identity stuff in
here, what’s a thief in a world without property?). Bane makes his deals
with capitalists to move the pieces into place, but where’s his similar
co-option of revolutionaries?</p>
<p>I am of course committing the classic critic mistake of demanding the
film-maker make a completely different film than the one they chose to
and it’s to the credit of the world building that you could fit a whole
mini-series (one I’d love to see) in what takes place over 15 minutes or
so - but as is, it’s hard to work out what Nolan’s actual take is here.
It’s clear that Bane isn't really in the revolution game and he's using
class conflict as the frayed thread that can be pulled to tear Gotham
apart (he’s almost mocking in handing Gotham ‘back to the people’) but
the film never really resolves if Gotham is in revolution or under
occupation - and there’s a thematic muddle as a result. How does the
film feel about Occupy? The trials for the wealthy? Is this about how
revolutions can go wrong? It might be, but we lack revolutionaries and
the only voices we hear are the ones we know to be disingenuous. Rise,
as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Want-to-Be-a-Part-of-the-Dark-Knight-Rises-Soundtrack-133435573.html">crowd-sourced
chorus</a>&nbsp;repeatedly
demands, but this isn’t a call to revolution, it's asking a great man to
appear - for an individual to climb out of the pit. The people will ask
for heroes, but they stay off the stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-robin">
<h2>The Rise of Robin</h2>
<p>Another way to look at the whole film is as a backstory for Robin (John
Blake, rhymes with Tim Drake - hey!) - what led this young police
officer to throw away his badge and take up the cape and cowl? Heroes in
this mold are are faced on both sides by agents of order and agents of
chaos and it’s the reasons they reject both that define them as
characters - Why doesn’t Bruce just join the police, why is Buffy
ill-suited for the Initiative?</p>
<p>In this light it’s worth looking at just how little John gets
accomplished in this film. Finds Commissioner Gordon, cool, realises the
masterplan to trap all the police underground (a plan that involves the
police suddenly reversing their previous strategy at the exact same time
as the football game, but anyway), cool but too late to do anything.
Tries to break out the underground cops, that didn’t work out, captured
and then freed by Batman who breaks them out more successfully - that’s
ok because he has a new mission leading an exodus over the bridge, but
that doesn’t work out either. I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing
that one of our main characters spends so much time running around not
accomplishing anything because viewed right that’s part of his
disenchantment. We see the final straw when the rigidity of the police
following orders on the other side dooms the bus full of orphans to
oblivion, but what happened to Blake in the Gotham anarchy that led to
that moment? Again, that would have made an interesting story - but
would have been at the expense of the one that was actually told.</p>

<h2>Loose thoughts</h2>

<li>Object that has been most unnecessarily shaped into a bat: darts.

<li>I swear there’s a line from Catwoman that’s lifted from the Halle

<li>Also: does she, or anyone else, ever refer to her as Catwoman?</li>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/libdems/4519924649/"><img alt="Election 2010 Day 9 - Nick Clegg &amp; Vince Cable Launch the 2010 Liberal Democrat Manifesto" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4007/4519924649_86f3dc20ee_n.jpg" /></a>In the Lords report on the Lords Reform Bill
there's some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#a60">interesting
discussion</a>
of if a referendum is required or&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;before reform can proceed.</p>
<p>Alongside the standard argument that major constitutional change should
require a referendum is the idea that as all three major parties entered
into the last election with a manifesto commitment&nbsp;to Lords reform, no
party has a mandate to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;Lords reform. This is on the face of
it, puzzling - if a policy is so popular that all parties feel
it&nbsp;advantageous&nbsp;to put in their&nbsp;manifesto how can whatever government
results not have a mandate as a result? Here's what was said (or
summarized at the end if you want to skip):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="373">
<li>...The Government's view is that:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;because all three parties were in favour of this, we did not think
that a referendum was justified. When the House of Lords
Constitution Committee looked at referendums, it said that it
thought that abolition of the House of Lords would be a subject on
which you would automatically want to have a referendum, but it did
not say that changing the composition of the House of Lords would be
such a proposition. So, no, we do not think that a referendum is
necessary, and that is why we did not propose it in our draft Bill
or White
Paper&quot;.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note438">438</a>]</p>
<p>373. Despite the constitutional importance of the subject, the lack
of a clear party division on the issue means that any opposition to
the proposed reform cannot readily be tested at any future election
by voting for one or other candidates seeking election to the House
of Commons. If the Government has its way, the draft Bill will have
become an Act before the next general election, at which the first
tranche of elected Members of a reformed House of Lords would be
seeking election. There is thus no opportunity for the electorate to
provide a mandate for these
proposals.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note439">439</a>]</p>
<p>374. Mr Christopher Hartigan, who described himself as &quot;a member of
the public with an interest in constitutional matters and Lords
Reform in particular&quot; put it:</p>
<p>The fact that elections were mentioned in the three manifestoes does
not mean it is the settled view of a party, it is not, or the
majority of members of a party agree with it or that the electorate
want it either. It can be said that the fact that it was in three
manifestos makes it clear that the people had no choice. It should
also be remembered all three parties LOST the election. ... If the
government believe this is the will of the people then it should
proceed on a free vote of their representatives or hold a
constitutional referendum before such important changes are made.</p>
<p>377. Professor Vernon Bogdanor told us in oral evidence that a
referendum would be the right way forward because all three parties
proposed an elected Lords in their election manifestos in 2010, so
there was no way for the voter to indicate his or her opinion: &quot;I
think it would be right to hold a referendum on this issue, which I
think is a greater change than the alternative vote system that has
been rejected&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substantial argument here is that&nbsp;politically popular is not the
same as popularly popular, the policy&nbsp;could in fact be a stitch-up among
the political class to deny choice on a certain issue while
the&nbsp;truly&nbsp;popular policy goes unexpressed.&nbsp;The point about mandates is
that they result from the public having made a set of choices of Party A
over Party B, if there was no&nbsp;differentiation, there was no choice to be
made, thus no mandate.</p>
<p>This makes the maths of mandates somewhat counter-intuitive. If we
imagine rival parties A and B and the mandate for policy X, we end up
with this strange table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>Party A</strong></td>
<td><strong>Party B</strong></td>
<td><strong>Mandate</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>A has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Y</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If no party is in support, there is no mandate for X, if every party is
in support, there is no mandate for X.&nbsp;If we take the idea of mandates
seriously for a minute this means if&nbsp;the other side steals your good
idea, then suddenly they've taken away your mandate to implement it.
Does that mean that policy X should be put to a referendum to gain its
mandate? Or if arguing that that's reserved for constitutional issues
(which X may not be),&nbsp;does it mean the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention">Salisbury
doctrine</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2011/07/04/salisbury-lords-reform-history/">if it
still
exists</a>)
shouldn't apply because X doesn't really have a mandate from the nation?</p>
<p>Added to that is a question of how different policies X and Y need to be
before the public can be said to have offered&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;choice. While
all three&nbsp;manifestos pledged to reform the House of Lords, Labour
differed in requiring a referendum, the Conservatives only committed to
a 'mainly-elected' chamber - are those differentiation enough that
voters had a choice?&nbsp;Labour wanted open-list PR, if the Lib Dems had put
their preference for STV into the manifesto would that have been making
a choice?</p>
<p>In this case the argument is limited to saying that an issue that would
otherwise require a referendum can go without if the election was fought
out on a very specific set of circumstances, but the general principle
is worth thinking about&nbsp;as&nbsp;there are any number of areas where overlap
between the parties is large. &nbsp;The argument is that certain manifesto
combinations shouldn't be given practical&nbsp;significance, but the
fiddlyness of the situation that results seems to argue pretty well that
manifesto&nbsp;commitments&nbsp;shouldn't have practical&nbsp;significance full stop.</p>
<p>This ultimately comes down to the old question of what exactly happens
in an election - are we empowering people to decide or people to
deliver? At various times manifestos were certainly viewed as binding -
Stanley Baldwin claimed the 1923 election was held solely to reverse a
manifesto&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;of his&nbsp;predecessor[1. Dennis Kavangh, '<a class="reference external" href="http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIV/1/7.extract">The
Politics of
Manifestos</a>',&nbsp;Parliamentary&nbsp;Affairs,
34(1),1981 ,p.8] - but Kavanagh argues that this becomes
increasingly&nbsp;untenable&nbsp;in the modern age:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead of the mandate referring to a major issue, governments now
use the term to justify a battery of items in the manifesto, however
picayune they may be. As pledges are fulfilled, so the government
spokesman claims that he has kept faith with the electorate,
regardless of the popularity of the measure. But it is the sheer
number of proposals in modern manifestos which weakens the notion of
the mandate as the conscious support of each manifesto proposal by a
person who votes for the party. It is because voters for a party
simply cannot be expected to be aware of all of the proposals, let
alone agree with them, that Finer makes the charge of &quot;manifesto
moonshine &quot; [2. Ibid. p. 9]</blockquote>
<p>This raises the obvious&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;about the idea of mandates: when
voters enter the voting booth are they really endorsing the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of
that party's manifesto? Might their decision perhaps be&nbsp;influenced&nbsp;by
other considerations? Can a party really claim a mandate from the nation
for a vague&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;hidden in a footnote on page five underneath the
'beware of the leopard' sign?</p>
<p>I think it'd be fair to say that today (ignoring fiddly issues such as
the position of coalition agreements) while 'mandate' is thrown around
as a useful bit of&nbsp;language, the predominate mindset is that
governments&nbsp;can do anything they can practically achieve and
that&nbsp;manifestos only have practical, as opposed to political,
significant in odd (and probably doomed) cases like the Salisbury
doctrine - on the basis of the above it's hard to say there's much wrong
with this.</p>
<p>I remain a bit unsure if the&nbsp;cancelling&nbsp;maths of mandates is something
that should be taken seriously but given both accepting it and rejecting
it stress the idea of manifesto mandates to breaking point it does
illustrate the underlying concept is a bit fragile and shouldn't be too
heavily relied on.&nbsp;For Lords reform,&nbsp;this means that if a referendum is
needed (and I think would be the last chance for groups like Unlock
Democracy to establish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/the-public-should-have-the-power-to-veto-elected-lords-not-another-vanity-r">an alternative
principle</a>),
a referendum is needed - and that in general we should shy away from
arrangements that give much practical importance to manifesto promises
(while of course being free to politically punish parties for breaking
them).</p>

				Jun 21, 2012
                
				
					<p>The goal with this post was to see if I&nbsp;could come up in a morning with
a quick method to test the 'politicalness' of eurovision voting. &nbsp;To
keep it simple I assumed that most 'political' voting was related to
cultural factors that would map onto geographical proximity and so the
question became 'Would countries give higher points to countries closer
to them than those further away'?&nbsp;Using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/Eurovision2010">this
dataset</a> of all results from
1998-2009 and the results from the Wikipedia pages for
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010">2010</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011">2011</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012">2012</a>, I
created a single dataset of all votes cast since 1998. Then I made a
list for each eurovision country of all other eurovision countries they
shared a border with. For countries bordering seas, I counted all
countries with reasonable straight lines across the water (erring on the
side of being over generous). From this I created a new variable
representing the degrees of separation between the source and
destination of all votes (where 1 means they share a border, 2 means
there’s one country in the middle and so on). This dataset is
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjeRO7qR270JdFhxSHU3ZVBNSG1MTXQ5aHZhZkhZamc#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>A robust regression shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship at the 1% level where each less degree of separation
between A and B increases the number of points transferred from A to B
by 0.39(±0.068). The exact coefficient varies year on year and the
relationship drops from significance in 1998 and 2001. As the first few
‘hops’ are likely to be the most important (it’s doubtful the hop from 4
to 5 degrees of separation is a serious consideration for anyone), it’s
worth re-running the regression looking only at if countries share a
border or not. From this we get another significant relationship where a
country will give around 1.9(±0.245) more points to countries it shares
a border with than those it won’t.</p>
<p>While it's nice to have a number on this we’re only explaining a few
percent of the overall vote transfer (2.6% when using all degrees
of&nbsp;separation&nbsp;and 4.6% when only using border/noborder) and it’s not at
all clear that ‘degrees of separation' &nbsp;are the best measurement of
geographic effects. Would the effect be larger or smaller if I was less
generous with borders over seas? Should we be looking at ‘regions’,
countries that share a language? This analysis used all votes cast, but
not all countries are regular players - the relationship might be
different if it was cut down to those who vote every time.</p>
<p>At this point rather than plough on, &nbsp;I decided to look up if anyone had
ever done any proper work on&nbsp;eurovision and found that of course they
have and a great common thread in these is some kind of justification
for having bothered to study something like Eurovision in the first
place.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>
is arguing Eurovision can be used to create a cultural structural
analysis of the post iron-curtain Europe and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn et
al</a> that the
&quot;Eurovision&nbsp;network&nbsp;is analogous to a range of other complex dynamic
networks involving&nbsp;the&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;of goods and opinions&quot;...which are
clearly just excuses.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn, Suleman, Efstathiou and
Johnson</a> (2006) looked at
Eurovision as a network in terms of &nbsp;how in sync countries are with each
other i.e. how similarly are their votes distributed when you ignore
their votes towards each other. They found that the UK was actually the
most 'in sync' with&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;in general between 1992 and 2003 and while
there were patterns that vindicated my geographical links such&nbsp;Estonia
being associated with the Nordic countries, others raise serious
problems with it such as Spain being absent from the group that includes
France and&nbsp;Portugal.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>(1995
- so an older study of a very different eurovision) similarly look at
network effects breaks down eurovision countries into &quot;five meaningful
cliques&quot;, which are further combined into Western, Northern and
Mediterranean blocs (where the last feels like a 'and the rest' bloc)
and that the then supremacy of countries in the Western Bloc was a
result of three of the most&nbsp;strongly&nbsp;knit cliques are located within it.
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=884379">Ginsburgh and
Noury</a>(2004)
is the closest to a more developed version of my attempt, looking at the
effect of cultural and linguistic proximity (which geographic proximity
would at best be acting as a proxy for) on points and finding that a)
these are important factors that far exceed the effects of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> and b) that the
'quality' of the song tends to have quite a large effect on the results.</p>
<p>So in a most boring answer, Eurovision turns out to be actually about
the music. But that's the numbers for you.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Sergebac7thcentury-150x150.jpg" />The Church of England's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1475149/s-s%20marriage.pdf">response</a>&nbsp;to
the consultation&nbsp;on same-sex marriage caused some waves this week.&nbsp;Given
the debates inside the church on homosexuality that the response isn't a
heartful endorsement isn't a huge surprise, but it's always a little bit
disappointing to be reminded that an organisation still so entwined with
the state holds these views.</p>
<p>It's well worth a read though, even if you find their arguments
unconvincing it's filled with interesting facts - did you know that you
have a right to be wed in your parish church and the vicar has to
perform it, regardless of your religious affiliation (or lack thereof)?
'The church will be forced to marry people!' has been out of the bag for
a while apparently.</p>
<p>I found a few sections in particular worth pulling out.&nbsp;The response
opens claiming that that the church has actually been pretty progressive
on same-sex couples in general but marriage is something that needs
special consideration:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;We have supported various legal changes in recent years to remove
unjustified discrimination and create greater legal rights for same
sex couples and we welcome that fact that previous legal and
material inequities between heterosexual and same-sex partnerships
have now been satisfactorily addressed.</blockquote>
<p>As has been pointed out a few times, this is a pretty generous
interpretion of the Church's history on the matter. Their contribution
to the Civil Partnership Bill in 2004 was notable for six bishops trying
to help <a class="reference external" href="http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/history-written-and-rewritten/">sink
it</a>
with a wrecking&nbsp;amendment, it's&nbsp;only fourteen years since the highest
figures in the church argued that gay people between 16 and 18 having
sex should <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/116865.stm">remain
criminalized</a>&nbsp;because
dropping the age of consent would send a 'wrong message', and in 2006
they <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6293115.stm">boldly stood up</a> for
the rights of the Catholic Church to have more opt-outs allowing
discrimination against same-sex couples.&nbsp;The Anglican community is
hardly <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2012/jun/12/church-of-england-gay-marriage">all on the same side on
this</a>,
but the direction the church has chosen to use its power is a little
revealing.</p>
<p>Next up is the claim that that marriage as currently stands is a
timeless institution that's existed pretty much forever - trying to put
it that arguing&nbsp;against one-man-one-woman marriage is like arguing
against gravity - it's just a fact, that's what&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In common with almost all other Churches, the Church of England
holds, as a matter of doctrine and derived from the teaching of
Christ himself, that marriage in general – and not just the marriage
of Christians – is, in its nature, a lifelong union of <strong>one man
with one woman</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Such a move would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the
union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>throughout history</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Throughout <strong>history</strong>, in the laws of the land and in the Church of
England‘s Book of Common Prayer on which the laws concerning
marriage are grounded, marriage has been <strong>understood to be, always
and exclusively, between a woman and a man.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The intrinsic nature of marriage, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>since before the advent of either church or state</strong>, is the union
of a man and a woman.</p>
<p>Marriage affords many benefits to society, which include
<strong>mutuality</strong>, fidelity and &nbsp;biological complementarity with the
possibility of procreation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another case where there's quite a substantial clash with
reality. Quite a few cultures have accepted definitions of marriage
outside of this, same-sex&nbsp;marriage has existed in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions">various forms at
various
times</a>, and
polygamous&nbsp;cultures are&nbsp;hardly rare - awkwardly several of them
documented this fact in their holy books and as a result there are
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_bibl0.htm">eight kinds of
marriage</a> sanctioned
in the Bible. While none of them are same sex as such, many differ from
the &quot;lifelong union of&nbsp;one man with one woman&quot; as has existed &quot;before
the advent of either church or state&quot;.</p>
<p>Mentioning 'mutuality' is an interesting point, because that's one
aspect of marriage that even within the Church's (relatively short)
history hasn't been constant. &nbsp;On page 2 they cite a definition
of&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts.aspx">Common
Worship</a>&nbsp;which
draws heavily on the marriage vows:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The Church of Christ understands marriage to be, in the will of
God, the union of a man and a woman, for better, for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,&nbsp;to love and to
cherish, till parted by death.&quot; (Common Worship: Pastoral Services,
page 177)</blockquote>
<p>But if we go back to<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-of-solemnization-of-matrimony.aspx">the Book of Common
Prayer</a>&nbsp;cited
above&nbsp;we quickly find a departure from this&nbsp;mutuality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long
as ye both shall live?</p>
<p>The Man shall answer,</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Then shall the Priest say unto the Woman,</p>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
<strong>obey him, and serve him</strong>, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness
and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so
long as ye both shall live?</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Woman shall answer,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I will.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/marriage.aspx">revised Common
Worship</a>
this has been ironed out and 'obey' banished to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/alternativetexts.aspx#vows">alternative
vows</a>&nbsp;(where
'serve' is nowhere to be found not technically being part of the vows in
the original). Now this shift isn't that&nbsp;obscure&nbsp;or hidden knowledge,
but that the mutual character of marriage is a somewhat modern
institution is something that the church should remember. They haven't
been protecting a perfectly Christian conception of marriage while the
rest of society muddled and changed it's definitions - they've been
right here with us as marriage evolved into what it is today.</p>
<p>This next one is my favourite:</p>
<blockquote>
To argue that this is of no social value is to assert that men and
women are simply interchangeable individuals. It also undermines
many of the arguments which <strong>support the deeper involvement of
women in all social institutions</strong> on the grounds that a society
cannot flourish without the specific and distinctive contributions
of each gender.</blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful argument that same-sex marriage undermines arguments
against sexism. After all, if we need women in every boardroom don't we
need them in every&nbsp;marriage?&nbsp;This is of course all the less convincing
coming from an organisation that is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18157584">at this very
moment</a> fudging the entry of
women into its corridors of power.</p>
<p>To round it off the annex plays some interesting games with definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only kind of marriage which English law recognises is one which
is&nbsp;essentially <strong>the voluntary union for life of one man with one
woman to the exclusion of all others.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>That institution would be one which was defined <strong>as the voluntary
union for life of any two persons</strong>. English law would, as a result,
cease to provide or recognise an institution that represented the
traditional understanding of marriage as the voluntary union for
life of one man with one woman</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the established institution of marriage, as currently defined and
recognised in English law, would in effect, have been abolished and
replaced <strong>by a new statutory concept which the Church – and many
outside the Church – would struggle to recognise as amounting to
marriage at all. A man and a woman who wished to enter into the
traditional institution of marriage would no longer have the
opportunity to do so.</strong> Only the new, statutory institution, which
defined a &nbsp;marriage‘ as the voluntary union of any two persons,
would be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, in the past marriage was between 'a man and a woman' now it'll
be between 'two persons' - this will totally ruin it for all those
couples that are made up of a man and woman but contain no persons!</p>
<p>It's hard to pin down why but I find this is one of the most
distasteful&nbsp;arguments in the whole thing. &nbsp;What they're implying here is
that there's&nbsp;harm in some way being done to heterosexual married couples
-&nbsp;that the marriage they had no longer existed, its gone, erased with a
pen-stroke, replaced by a ghoul that wears its face but isn't the same
at all. It crosses the line from inventing history to inventing harm,
and there's something ugly in that.</p>

					<p>I've been listening to lots of interesting comments on the
Independence&nbsp;Referendum&nbsp;debate recently&nbsp;and thought it was probably
worth getting all my notes somewhere in a coherent form.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;shied&nbsp;away
from developments on the substance of independence or devolution towards
issues relating the process and form of the referendum itself (and the
post is large enough just focusing on those questions). The following is
based on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">an&nbsp;event at the Constitution
Unit</a>&nbsp;with
<a class="reference external" href="http://constitution-unit.com/2012/03/12/scottish-independence-referendum-should-be-lawful-fair-and-decisive/">Prof. Robert
Hazell</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan Trench</a>&nbsp;and two
panels before the Scottish Affairs Committee, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10452">one quizzing
academics</a>
(for the purposes of this post, Panel A) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">the other quizzing both
sides of the AV
campaign</a>
(Panel B).</p>
<p><em>Panel A:</em></p>
<div><p>Professor Vernon Bogdanor, Research Professor at King’s College London</p>
</div><div><div><p>Professor John Curtice, Professor of Politics University of Strathclyde</p>
</div><div><p>Peter Kellner, President, YouGov</p>
</div></div><div><p>Professor Iain McLean, Official Fellow in Politics, Nuffield College,
University of Oxford</p>
</div><p><em>Panel B:</em></p>

</div><div><p>Katie Ghose - Chair of Yes To Fairer Votes, Chief Executive of Electoral
Reform Society (ERS)</p>
</div><div><p>William&nbsp;Norton -&nbsp;Responsible Person for NOTOAV&nbsp;and referendum agent for
No campaign for NE Referendum 2004</p>
<p>Willie Sullivan - Head of Field Operations for yes to fairer votes,&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;director of Electoral Reform Society (ERS).</p>
</div><p>I've also included some brief comments from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=9307">the Electoral Commission
evidence</a>,
but for the most part the debate has changed enough to make much of that
session irrelevant.</p>
<div class="section" id="role-of-the-electoral-commission">
<h2><strong>Role of the Electoral Commission</strong></h2>
<p>The general consensus from Panels A &amp; B that the currently proposed
question is unfair, but Curtice points out that Electoral Commission
corrections haven't always been completely&nbsp;unobjectionable&nbsp;so wouldn't
go as far as to make the commission's comments on questions binding.
Along those lines&nbsp;Norton argued it'd be unnecessary as proceeding with
a&nbsp;question&nbsp;the Electoral Commission had labelled dodgy would be a gift
to the&nbsp;disadvantaged&nbsp;campaign anyway so sufficient political incentives
exist without mandating use of the electoral commission formulation.
&nbsp;Kellner made the case that the question doesn't actually make that much
difference, something interesting for a pollster to say as question
effects can have a large effect on how people answer. &nbsp;However I can see
there being a case for not applying polling logic to referenda as most
voters will be exposed to the campaigns long before the ballot and so
question-wording effects could be far less strong than in polling. &nbsp;He
argued what was far more important was that the question be&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;to
be fair, and the Electoral Commission role in this regard
is&nbsp;creating&nbsp;demonstrable&nbsp;justice rather than creating an unproblematic
question.</p>
<p>There was a general feeling in panel A however that in the event of
referendum where there might be other&nbsp;contentious&nbsp;structural issues
other than the question (such as the form of questions and counting
system to choose between three or more options) that the commission's
advisory role should be expanded to include those issues.&nbsp;In Panel B
there was opposition&nbsp;to the idea of the electoral commission producing
more material, with both sides pointing out they objected to the neutral
material during the AV campaign. Sullivan argued that it probably wasn't
cost-effective and the money might be better spent on more broadcasts -
which Elliot argued there should be more of, but shorter to fit in
better with how people understand adverts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-a-yes-no-format-matter">
<h2><strong>Does a 'yes/no' format matter?</strong></h2>
<p>The former Scottish First Minister Lord McConnell has suggested <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9141435/Lord-McConnell-Hold-referendum-on-straight-question-within-18-months.html">that
votes should select from
duelling&nbsp;statements</a>&nbsp;(i.e.
something like 'Scotland should be an independent country'', 'Scotland
should remain part of the UK'') rather than answering a yes/no question
to&nbsp;deprive the SNP of the advantage of running a 'yes' campaign, but
from the AV teams there wasn't an impression that this was hugely
important.&nbsp;Elliot argued that actually yes/no isn't hugely important (or
at least that slanting is variable on economic conditions and national
mood rather than an inherent bias either way) and the debate can still
be defined in those terms even if the question isn't, with the example
of how the 1997 Scottish referendum was covered by the media as a yes/no
campaign despite it a question of&nbsp;duelling&nbsp;statements. Sullivan thought
that the big difference was 'change/status quo' which exists however the
question is worded, and that the advantage will rest with&nbsp;the&nbsp;status
quo. The take away message here being that there probably isn't a lot of
point in trying to avoid a 'yes/no' question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-there-be-multiple-options">
<h2><strong>Should there be multiple options?</strong></h2>
<p>Kellner said it would be 'perverse' if some kind of devo-max wasn't an
option and as Bogdanor&nbsp;nicely put it &quot;it'd be very odd that an
instrument designed to discover what Scottish people think
should&nbsp;exclude&nbsp;the option that they most favour&quot;.&nbsp;Trench argued that
most Scots want around 65% change which is closer to independence than
not, so it could well in the unionist's interests to put forward a
devolution option and that the current Unionist pursuit of a 'jam
tomorrow' option where a No vote on&nbsp;independence&nbsp;would be rewarded with
further devolution could well run into a credibility problem&nbsp;as the
recommendations of Calman Commission have yet to pass into law - giving
a bad record for the UK government's ability to proactively manage
further devolution.</p>
<p>There's a related point that even if there's only one question on the
ballot, there's still a decent case to be made for having multiple
referendums on that single question.&nbsp;As it was unlikely
that&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;or consensus on indepedence or even agreement on
certain flavours of devolution could be reached before the vote
(although Kellner pointed out, a lot of it will become apparent within
the&nbsp;campaign)&nbsp;Panel A were quite keen on the need for two referendums,
one enabling&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;and another post-negotiations&nbsp;binding
referendum for agreement to terms and Trench <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scotland-may-need-two-referendums-and-process-is-flawed-expert-claims-1-2179480">similarly supports
this</a>.
In Panel B, Sullivan indicated that the ERS wasn't&nbsp;wholly supportive of
that (or at least, much less than their evidence would suggest).</p>
<p>Panel A raised concerns about the content of Devo-Max, mainly that it's
as yet ill-defined and needs to be more so before the referendum&nbsp;(the
arrival of devo-plus on the scene may or may not change this situation).
Bogdanor put forward that if it's an option it not only needs to be
defined but needs to be shown what is on offer is&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;an option
from Westminster. Noton pointed out that the North-East devolution,
welsh powers and AV referendums had outcomes that were well-known and
thought out before the election. He argues that it's fundamentally a
unionist proposal and it's up to the unionist side to define it (which
raises the question of who's actually for the status quo, but we'll get
to that in a bit). &nbsp;McLean again argued that it isn't realistic for all
the negotiations to happen ahead of time, hence the idea of a second
confirming referendum.</p>
<p>Ghose and Sullivan agreed that a three option referendum could probably
have three campaigns, which brings up the issue that the&nbsp;Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 &nbsp;(PPERA) has an&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">'all or
nothing'
rule</a>&nbsp;for
having a&nbsp;designated&nbsp;lead campaign, something that could be interesting
in a three-way referendum as it's not at all clear who the groups that
would argue for each option would be - you'd expect a common unionist
position to emerge and it's not clear if that would be devo-max or the
status quo. Depending on the exact details of a devolution option, there
might of course be a three-way split but in the event that this doesn't
happen it's not clear if any lead campaigns are allowed (Referendum
legislation could of course amend PPERA to allow a minimum of two).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-should-a-multi-question-referendum-be-conducted">
<h2><strong>How should a multi-question referendum be conducted?</strong></h2>
<p>In&nbsp;terms&nbsp;of precedent, the New Zealand electoral system&nbsp;referendum&nbsp;was
mentioned by Kelner, Sullivan and Hazell as an example of how a
multi-option referedum might be conducted.&nbsp;This is is one sense good
precedent being a multi-option referendum from a&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;style
parliamentary democracy, but as it's the&nbsp;example&nbsp;that comes up again and
again it does illustrate that this is relatively new ground and the door
is open for pretty much anything to happen here and
create&nbsp;precedent.&nbsp;Kellner also pointed out the 1997 Scottish devolution
referendum was effectively a three option vote, so it's not completely
without UK&nbsp;precedent, although in this case all three camps would
stronger options. Similarly Norton brought up the North East 2004
referendum as an example but also pointed out as the second question was
a&nbsp;subsidiary&nbsp;question, all campaigning focused on the first question.</p>
<p>The SNP's double question (the problems with which I went into
<a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">here</a>)
seems to have mostly gone away at this point and Panel A were divided on
the best way to go foward. Kellner has previously written something
helpful about the <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">five possible ways of doing
this</a>and
he and McLean both favoured a ballot that allowed people to rank '1' and
'2' which is then counted by the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
method</a>. In the
unlikely event of a Condorcet loop, McLean would want something in the
referendum legislation to deal with it and suggests defaulting to the
status quo. Bogdanor&nbsp;suggested a three option ballot with a later
run-off election and Curtice a gateway question approach, with the first
question giving a choice for&nbsp;independence and if that fails, question
two giving the choice between status quo and devo max.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS favours
a different gateway question, with the first being a question about
change in principle, the second then being a choice between the two
change options.</p>
<p>As Alan Reid called Sullivan on, the problem with the ERS question is it
only allows the status quo to a voter's first or last preference and
'Devo Max, status quo, independence' is a perfectly likely ordering (and
such a voter could end up empowering their least favoured option by
voting in accordance with their most) - a similar problem holds for
Curtice (it's the flaw of the gateway question in&nbsp;principle) but in this
case it's&nbsp;independence&nbsp;that can only be placed first or last, something
that's possibly more in key with actual preferences.&nbsp;McLean and Kellner
were opposed to runoffs and AV on the grounds that&nbsp;an option like Devo
Max could be the Condorcet winner and the consensus choice but if it
came third in the first round it'd be removed.&nbsp;Panel B very briefly
ventured onto this territory giving us the memorable moment of a former
member of the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign&nbsp;saying &nbsp;'it wouldn't work'
but alas they didn't go further into it.&nbsp;Trench questioned if you could
get a mandate from&nbsp;preferential&nbsp;voting, but this would presumably be
less of an issue with a run-off referendum.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="election-timing">
<h2><strong>Election Timing</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor argues that the referendum should happen sooner rather than
later as the issues aren't that complicated and the continued
uncertainty could be causing economic damage (a point he'd repeat from
the audience at the Con Unit). McLean argued in response that the
biggest economic issue is currency for&nbsp;Scotland's&nbsp;large financial
industry - and that this is an issue that could be addressed (and there
is incentive for both sides to do so) well before the referendum, making
timing less of an issue.</p>
<p>Hazell disagreed with Bogdanor that economic grounds were enough to
justify Westminster interference in picking a date, and argued
that&nbsp;there are two legitimate concerns for the UK&nbsp;government&nbsp;regarding
the time - avoiding a day that clashes with another election, and also
one that would come close to the next general election as this would
create <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/scottish-referendum-date-matters?">constitutional
awkwardness</a>
in the event of a vote for independence if a general
election&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;between the yes vote and independence - Scottish MPs
would be returned and potentially help form a&nbsp;government&nbsp;before
disappearing again.</p>
<p>This suggests that a date should be picked with regard to being able to
wrap up potential&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;before May 2015 - however the assumption
here is that the fixed parliament will last that long &nbsp;-&nbsp;over at the LSE
Politics and Policy blog Patrick Dunleavy is <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2012/02/20/general-election-2014-dunleavy/">not at all
convinced</a>
that the coalition will go the distance, expecting a dissolution and
Conservative and Labour agreement on an early election sometime in 2014
- in which case it's probably too late to avoid the problem above.
However this exact question and an ongoing referendum through 2014 might
actually either reinforce the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;or at least
create&nbsp;disincentives&nbsp;for Labour to agree to dissolve&nbsp;parliament (Keeping
Scotland in the union is strongly in the party's interest and may
deplete campaigning funds to an extent that they don't want to run a
general election the same year) and&nbsp;hence make the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;more likely
to run it's full course - so it's possibly everything cancels out here.</p>
<p>On a related time issue is the length of control period and the campaign
in general, which there was a general consensus in panel B that a longer
period was better and that the campaign needed at least twelve months.
&nbsp;Norton&nbsp;argued&nbsp;that 10 weeks control period simply wasn't enough time to
deal with the&nbsp;practicalities and time taken along the critical path to
the free post mailshots - in 2004 his campaign almost missed the
deadline and the NotoAV campaign this time around started printing
before they were&nbsp;officially&nbsp;the&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaign.&nbsp;The main problem
(that's probably&nbsp;unresolvable) with referenda as opposed
to&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament&nbsp;elections (and now&nbsp;possibly Westminster) is
there's no fixed time for the election to work towards and there’s an
incentive to do what the SNP are doing and have a long pre-legislation
period (still &nbsp;a year to go before that according to their timetable)
where campaign actions can’t be monitored because
there’s&nbsp;officially&nbsp;nothing to campaign about going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="franchise">
<h2><strong>Franchise</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor thinks the voting age should be 16, but
that&nbsp;referenda&nbsp;shouldn't be special and the existing&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;should
apply. Curtice argues that changing the francise would be opening a can
of worms in terms of ideas about nationality and that&nbsp;&nbsp;it'd be
technically difficult to get people on the register anyway. Andrew
Scallan (Director of Electoral Administration at The Electoral
Commission)&nbsp;spent a long time not wanting to give a precise answer as to
how long the process of expanding the registers would take (more than
week, less than a year) but did suggest the best scenario would be
legislation in the summer followed by a household canvas in the
Autumn,&nbsp;but&nbsp;at other times of year the process might be more
difficult/result in a less complete register.</p>
<p>Interestingly as it's a local government francise EU citizens would be
able to vote but as typically they're bared from national elections
(which elections for a&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament would become in the event of
an independence win) means that they could effectively vote to remove
their own representation. Curtice points out however that they're
unlikely to vote at all so it's a bit of a moot point.</p>

<p>The role of the rest of the UK in this decision is&nbsp;variable&nbsp;on outcome,
Mclean argues that Scotland could declare independence&nbsp;unilateral&nbsp;but
could not declare devo max&nbsp;unilateral, as devolution would be a gift of
powers from Westminster. This distinction is less than it seems though
as the kind of independence that the SNP describes includes some quite
complex inter-dependence that would similarly require UK consent.&nbsp;Trench
said that a referendum on devo-max could include the rest of the UK &nbsp;(I
think I'd be correct in describing his view as falling far shorter than
'should'), Hazell was content that it could be negotiated by the
government. If the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;in general has been for referendums to
devolve powers, the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;is also that only the affected region
votes.</p>

<p>During the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">AV Campaigns
evidence</a>
for the Scottish Affairs Committee, David Mowat (Conservative
MP)&nbsp;brought up in passing the idea that devo-max could involve an
element of reduction of&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;seats in&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;in exchange for
powers, an idea that's appearing in a few places (just a few examples,
this&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ditchley.co.uk/page/384/annual-lecture-xlvii.htm">speech</a>&nbsp;by
John Major and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">this
article</a>
in the&nbsp;Scotsman) and I thought it was worth branching off this
discussion into a new post.</p>
<p>At one level the position is understandable,&nbsp;reducing seats was how
historically devolution used to work with a reduction in Irish seats
when home rule was introduced in 1921.&nbsp;The idea that seat allocation was
related to national status received more&nbsp;systematic&nbsp;backing at the 1944
Speaker's Convention where the principle was agreed that there was a
case for &quot;substantial representation&quot; of a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;nation beyond what
mathematical divisions would provide.</p>
<p>However now the principle of electoral equality has completely swept
this approach away.</p>
<p>To trace the most&nbsp;official&nbsp;examples, the idea of reducing Scottish and
Welsh seats pops up several times in the Justice Committee
Report&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmjust/529/529i.pdf">&quot;Devolution: A Decade
On&quot;</a>&nbsp;and
the most precise formulation is cited from a Constitution Unit Report by
Robert Hazell: &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/publications/tabs/unit-publications/141.pdf">Towards a New Constitutional Settlement: An Agenda for
Gordon Brown’s First 100 Days and
Beyond</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One partial solution Gordon Brown could consider is to harmonise the
electoral quotas of the four UK territories, ending English
under-representation, or even to reduce the representation of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to two-thirds that of
England*.</p>
<p>*This solution has historic precedent in that during the operation
of the Northern Ireland Parliament (1922-72) Northern Ireland had 12
MPs, &nbsp;rather than the 18 its population demanded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Justice Committee Report is a little sly in this respect, reframing
this as:</p>
<blockquote>
The latter approach was taken when the 1922 Parliament of Northern
Ireland was created, and Northern Ireland MPs were reduced to
twelve. In 2005 the number of Scottish MPs was reduced from 72 to
59. (pp. 61-62)</blockquote>
<p>The implication being that the 2005 reduction is another example of the
principle at work in the Northern Ireland example when it's actually
just a delayed&nbsp;consequence&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Scotland Act 1998, which I'd argue is
working under quite different principles.</p>
<p>Now in a crude way the Act could be seen as being a 'seats for powers'
transaction as it both create a devolved body and decreases seats (that
link &nbsp;is made pretty explicitly by that piece in
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">Scotsman</a>),
but the method it uses to do so is significant.</p>
<p>The reduction in seats removes the minimum of 71 seats and a
separate&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;quota, ending over-representation of Scotland - but
the method used more&nbsp;represents a principle of electoral equality
by&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/86">syncing the Scottish&nbsp;electoral&nbsp;quota with the English
quota</a>,
something that was repeated and taken further with<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/part/2">&nbsp;the creation of a
UK-wide quota</a>&nbsp;by
the&nbsp;Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011.</p>
<p>The trend through these changes has been an effective reduction of seats
in devolved regions (or will be if the current boundary proposals are
ever passed), but the justifying principle in these cases was &quot;one
person, one vote&quot; not &quot;seats for powers&quot;.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;successive&nbsp;change has
been in favour of greater and stricter stress being giving
to&nbsp;mathematical equality on constituency apportionment, so to at this
point give Scotland less representation because of greater devolution
would be a step backwards.</p>
<p>Although there's historical&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;it's worth considering that how we
understand seats and apportionment has undergone&nbsp;enormous&nbsp;shifts since
1921.&nbsp;Today the idea that national representation should be considered
is completely lacking from the law governing apportionment.&nbsp;It's also
not at all clear it resolves the problems it's supposed to address. Is
the West Lothian question really resolved by slightly fewer Scottish MPs
voting on English matters?&nbsp;Similarly, on matters like defence and
foreign affairs, there's no particular reason why Scottish voices should
matter less on the issues they would still return MPs on.</p>
<p>As a compromise to save the union it could be a short-lived one. &nbsp;In
answer to a question on&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">his
presentation</a>
at the Constitution Unit <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan
Trench</a> put forward that
devo-max might be an unstable position as foreign policy can often be a
wedge issue &nbsp;- would this situation be better or worse if Scotland had a
legitimate&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;of unequal representation in crafting that policy
added to it?</p>
<p>But on the practical side assuming an 'English votes on English issues'
rule, Scottish MPs would be left with far less to do (especially if
their ability to sit on committees is restricted) and their non-voting
functions probably could be done by fewer MPs.&nbsp;If so reducing their
number would seem to be a good idea not only to avoid waste, but to
ensure the job is still active enough to attract good candidates. But
how can this be done while still respecting voter equality?</p>
<p>The solution is to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;the idea of an MP's vote from their physical
person.&nbsp;Scottish voters are entitled to have their votes weighed the
same as those in the other nations - but Scottish MPs don't need to have
the same voting power as other MPs. The voting power of Scottish MPs
could be increased to&nbsp;allow both a reduction in numbers and also
preserve&nbsp;mathematical&nbsp;equality (for a reduction of 2/3 this would give
Scottish MPs a vote worth one and a half their current vote, and so on).</p>
<p>Weighted voting isn't a new idea in principle but it's one that's rarely
been used in the UK - I think it's a good one to think more about in
this case as it allows respect for both voter equality and the fact that
more devolution will have practical effects at Westminster.</p>
