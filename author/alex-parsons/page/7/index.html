					<p>The<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16561604">BBC
reports</a>
that Westminster is claiming a Scottish&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum wouldn't
be able to use the full electoral roll, which seems a bit strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: &quot;The UK government has
set out very clearly that the Scottish government cannot legislate
lawfully for a referendum with its current powers.</p>
<p>&quot;The full electoral register can only be used for specific purposes
such as the general or Holyrood elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The legal position is clear - if the SNP attempts to go ahead with
its own referendum then it will be nothing more than an opinion
poll, with a million Scots unable to be asked for their view.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true this means many potential voters could be excluded as they're
not on the&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;available (reduced) register. As a layman I've had a
quick skim of some of the acts related to the electoral register and
according to the explanatory note of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1872/note/made">Representation of the People
(Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations
2002</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A copy of the full version of the register may not be supplied by a
registration officer otherwise than in accordance with an enactment
(which, by virtue of the definition in inserted regulation 92(2),
includes subordinate legislation) including the principal
Regulations (inserted regulation 94(3)).</blockquote>
<p>The effect of which includes an enactment to be &nbsp;'any provision of, or
of any instrument made under, an&nbsp;Act of the Scottish Parliament' via
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/2/contents">Representation of the People Act
2000</a>. &nbsp;Which,
again I might be misreading, I take to mean the Scottish Parliament can
in principle have referenda using the electoral roll. If they can use it
for even a non-binding question about a reserved power is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/nov/08/uk-supreme-court-scottish-independence">contested</a>.</p>
<p>As Matt Qvortrup&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/dr_matt_qvortrup_scotland_does_not_need_permission_to_go_it_alone_1_2047506">sort of
argues</a>in
the Scotsman, the international recognition of self-determination (which
I think is less strong than he suggests, but going with it) would likely
mean in the event that Scotland holds a democratically legitimate but
illegal referendum, it would likely have to be recognised by Westminster
- which is why moves to&nbsp;de-legitimize&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;vote by arguing
people will be excluded make sense, and as I've said before the SNP
should be careful to avoid <a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">ambiguous questions that give rise to these
kinds of
challenges</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ah, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/referendum/4093-conservative-scaremongering-over-electoral-register-dismissed-as-qnonsenseq">clearer
copy</a>
of SNP statement that seems to support my point.</p>
<blockquote>
However a spokesperson for the Scottish government rejected Mr
Mundell's and noted that the referendum would be carried out after
the appropriate legislation was passed at Holyrood, ensuring full
access to the register.</blockquote>

					<div><p>I went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/parliamentary_boundary_review">a talk by Ron Johnston, Charles Pattie and David
Rossiter</a>
at the Constitution Unit yesterday on the in-progress boundary reviews
(their slides at link). It was interesting in the sense that it
confirmed with figures the kind of problems they’d previously predicted
with the review and I’m just going to throw down a few notes while it’s
fresh in my mind.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="building-blocks-and-displacement">
<h2>Building blocks and displacement</h2>
<div><p>This review represents the triumph, though possibly only temporarily, of
the mathematical principle (all constituencies should have equal numbers
of electors) over the organic principle (constituencies should reflect
real communities and locations) with a tighter than ever constraint on
elector numbers. A basic problem of requiring constituency electors to
fall within a certain range is that the building block used (wards) are
too often too big to construct constituencies within the range.</p>
<p>Interestingly the English and Scottish commissions have different ways
of dealing with this, the English method being to cross borders to make
up the numbers, whereas the Scottish commission splits wards. &nbsp;They
pretty conclusively demonstrated the Scottish method is less disruptive,
measured by relative numbers of ‘suboptimally&nbsp;placed (SP) electors’, who
are electors displaced from the majority of their compatriots in their
local authority, old constituency or ward. This does make sense
intuitively, as crossing borders pushes the imbalance over into the next
region and requires aggregate more slight movements of voters, but it’s
good to have numbers on it.</p>
<p>The idea that SPs should be minimized is a good measure, but I wonder if
the principle could be extended. If the proposed ‘one review a
parliament’ schedule is kept up, in the worst case you could find voters
who are moved around at every election - another possible measure would
be to try and minimize the number of people who have been SPs more than
once (TSPs?).</p>
<p>As the general trend is towards larger wards, they suggested using
polling districts as a possible smaller building block. The other option
they suggested in 2009 (with McLean) was

<div class="section" id="public-hearings-and-political-effects">
<h2>Public Hearings and political effects</h2>
<div><p>It was interesting to hear that the public hearings (essentially
curtailed versions of the public inquires) are still a vehicle for
parties even if their&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to input has been reduced (limited to 40
minute slots). This isn’t entirely surprising as parties have the
greatest interest in the result - I’m going to bring in here a bit here
something I wrote at the time the bill was going through about the
relationship between parties and the inquiries:</p>
</div>

    <div>

 As boundary matters are decided in the UK by the apolitical Boundary
 Commission, what happens is whenever we have a debate about
 apportionment it rapidly becomes a debate about competing metrics of
 fairness, where each side just so happens to align with the position
 that's seen to result in a better deal for them. Natural population
 movement tends to lead to more boundaries that favour Labour over
 time and so in general Labour has been opposed both to frequent
 redistributions and now, very clearly, stricter equalisation. It's
 not a coincidence that it's the same party that postponed the
 acceptance of new boundaries until after the election in 1969 is now
 dragging it's feet in the Lords but equally the Conservative
 position isn't much deeper, if situations were reversed I've no
 doubt we'd see the same in the other direction. However, that a
 position has political advantages doesn't stop it being a correct
 one.

 …

 It's interesting that one of concessions given in the Lords seems to
 be `the return of public
 inquiries <http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6661493/wheeling-and-dealing-over-the-av-bill.thtml>`__
 as I thought that removing them was one of the more interesting
 elements of the plan. Public inquiries have a number of issues, they
 make the process very time consuming (which is an issue if we're
 going to have to have a review every parliament), tend to increase
 deviations from the quota size, but most importantly public inquires
 are one of the few ways for political parties to influence the
 decision of the Boundary Commission. What you sometimes get is that
 political parties will show up at the Inquiry with alternate plans,
 which as long as they fulfil the commission's criteria better than
 the Commission's own plan it has no grounds to reject on the basis
 that it's more partisan[1. Lots of interesting discussion of this in
 D. J Rossiter, R.J Johnson, and C. J Pattie, The Boundary
 Commissions: Redrawing the UKʼs map of Parliamentary Constituencies,
 (Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2009), pp. 246-262] .
 Being apolitical means it can't consider the political consequences
 of its work, this is far from saying there are none. Given the
 inherent political nature of their work, Richard Morill `makes the
 interesting
 argument <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X2W-4XSF2CP-3&_user=10&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F1987&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1626703844&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d2b5fce8f7a5050618d81c54db5a1dcd&searchtype=a>`__
 that political ends should be directly considered by apportionment
 bodies and that they should set out to create certain numbers of
 safe and marginal seats rather than pretending its work has no
 impact on these questions, but its hard to see this view gaining
 much currency in British circles.

<div class="section" id="relationship-to-electoral-system">
<h2>Relationship to electoral system</h2>
<div><p>Something that was danced around in the Q&amp;A is the way in which the
boundary commission is related to the voting system. In many way the
boundary commission is the dark and complicated back-end of the ‘simple’
FPTP system (or any single-member system like AV) in that single-member
constituencies are smaller than multi-member constituencies, and so are
more vulnerable to population shifts (and the problem of building block
size mentioned earlier), plus the all-or-nothing nature of the systems
make the partisan implications of boundaries a bigger issue than they
might otherwise be. This isn’t a hugely live issue (as was pointed out
the boundary proposals might be unpopular among MPs but changing the
voting system is even more so) but it’s worth remembering it all fits
together.</p>
<p>While district magnitude and electoral system have effects on the
importance of boundaries, something that’s thought about less is that
ultimately the conflict between the organic and mathematical criteria
are the result of the fixing representative voting weight at ‘1’.
&nbsp;Trying to express both through the same measure (boundaries) inevitably
requires one to be prioritized over the other, what we need to do is
open up another stream to get the information into the chamber.</p>
<p>What Toplek
<a class="reference external" href="http://templelaw.tenintenclients.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toplak.pdf">proposes</a>[2.
Link takes you to pdf, but ref is:&nbsp;Jurij Toplak, ‘Equal voting weight of
all: Finally &quot;One Person, One Vote&quot; from Hawaii to Maine?’, Temple Law
Review, Vol. 81, 2008, pp. 123-178]&nbsp;in the context of the US is rather
than endlessly debate methods of dividing seats among the states on the
basis of their population, use any method but then give a state’s reps a
voting power that is equal to the population of that state. Using
representative voting weight as the means of expressing mathematical
equality frees up the boundary process to deviate in size to allow more
‘natural’ constituencies (even extreme deviations in size could then be
permitted within the system without being exceptions).</p>
<p>This doesn’t resolve all the problems of boundaries (safe seats, etc)
but it does resolve the current debate in a much easier (and cheaper)
way. &nbsp;Beyond that fix, [laying with representative voting weight opens
up a whole new realm of possible electoral structures, including methods
of dynamic apportionment which reduce the need for boundary reviews even
further and more exact methods of proportional representation. But
that’s a matter for future posts.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thos003/5986220278/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6148/5986220278_9635614fc2_m.jpg" /></a>I've been re-reading parts of Scott's '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seeing-Like-State-Condition-Agrarian/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a
State</a>'
for a class, and it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me his basic frame is something that is
useful for&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;various changes in Facebook.&nbsp;One of his recurring
ideas is that the state as it develops&nbsp;homogenizes various features of
the society to allow the 'center' to better gather&nbsp;information&nbsp;about its
capacities and so more effectively govern and rule. This goes from grid
cities eliminating the need for local knowledge and maps to navigate, to
standardization on language to remove the need for local interpreters,
the creation of fixed last names for the purpose of tax collection and
so on - devices that are designed to undermine the importance of local
knowledge and make the society more legible to outsiders.</p>
<p>To a certain extent we can see&nbsp;Facebook take similar paths as it
develops, the most obvious example being when the open-ended 'About Me'
text fields (for interests, sports, movies, music etc) were converted
into a system of links to pages (for various interest, sports, movies,
music, etc) where a user selects which links they want to connect to
their profile.</p>
<p>The old system was very local, I can look at my friends' pages and see
what their interests are and&nbsp;vice&nbsp;versa, it's a system for people who
know each other to share&nbsp;information&nbsp;with each other. While it works
well for one-on-one human interaction, it has a number of disadvantages
for Facebook's position at the center - to&nbsp;find out if someone has 'X'
as in interest, they have to search their database which is time and
resource consuming as most of their lots of users probably don't mention
'X' at all. In addition to that, what if someone spells it wrong? Or
uses a local label, or a variation on it? In those&nbsp;conditions, there is
an awful lot of&nbsp;information&nbsp;inside Facebook that it effectively has no
idea about, because it doesn't have cheap and&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;ways of accessing
it.</p>
<p>If we imagine Facebook as a series of nodes (people, pages), links
between nodes, and prongs (information associated with a single note) -
it is prongs that cause this difficulty for Facebook. From their
perspective it makes sense to try to convert prongs to links because
links are nicely&nbsp;quantifiable&nbsp;and trackable - it's a much simple matter
to find out how many users have linked to 'X', and also how many are
linked to Y'. &nbsp;But this process was a simplification of the range of
expression&nbsp;available&nbsp;to users, done in the interest of making
the&nbsp;information&nbsp;present within&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;more legible to the center. Most
tellingly, similar&nbsp;to how this development in the state is associated
with improved tax collection, better knowledge of its users makes their
knowledge base more valuable to outsiders, who pay Facebook for access
to it. Making people legible is a way of converting them into money.</p>
<p>On a bit of a side-note from that, Facebook often claims that
all&nbsp;information&nbsp;shared with it is entirely&nbsp;voluntary&nbsp;but something you
see sometimes is them attempting to&nbsp;manipulate&nbsp;people to share
certain&nbsp;information&nbsp;through UI design. In one of the re-designs last
year, the&nbsp;employment&nbsp;and education fields jumped out of being hidden on
a back page to being the first thing underneath your name, one of the
most important places on the screen and something you'd be prompted to
fill in everytime you visited your own page. &nbsp;I suspect this is a result
of their decision to switch away from networks as a means of
organisation and privacy control - networks were also a source
of&nbsp;information, if you're in the Durham network you're highly likely to
be a current or recent Durham student (and there were briefly corporate
networks for catching graduates and the general public). By removing the
importance of networks, there's no incentive for people to join networks
and share that&nbsp;information&nbsp;about their education or employment, hence
the quality of their&nbsp;information&nbsp;degraded and they needed to encourage
more people to give them back the&nbsp;information&nbsp;they'd lost through these
other means. Now of course, you still choose if you fill it in or not -
but I bet a lot more people did than who would have otherwise, Facebook
isn't neutral or passive about which&nbsp;information&nbsp;it wants.</p>

both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&nbsp;indulge&nbsp;their darker selves. &nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&nbsp;massacre.&nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&quot;)&nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.</p>
<p>I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&nbsp;Chris Applegate <a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp">points
out</a> the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf">Guardian Screen Burn
column</a>&nbsp;(
p191)&nbsp;in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.</p>
</div><div><p>The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div><p>This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.</p>
<p>In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.</p>
<p>UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html">used on the BBC
website</a>).&nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&nbsp;that their&nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.</p>
</div><div><p>That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media">in promotion of Black
Mirror</a>:</p>

    <div>

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

    <div>

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div><p>But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&nbsp;A&nbsp;longer&nbsp;stretch&nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:</p>

<div><p>What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&nbsp;In this sense it's a&nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.</p>
<p>Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&quot;</p>
<p>You pay the licence fee, you decide.</p>

                </h2>
				Nov 23, 2011
                
				
					<p>The idea of the 'human mic' was one born out of a practical necessity,
the police prevented the first OWS protests from
having&nbsp;electronic&nbsp;amplification so to compensate the mechanism of the HM
emerged, where the person currently with the 'mic' would say a short
phrase of their statement, which those around them would shout, before
the speaker moved onto the next phase and so on - there's a good example
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIK7uxBSAS0">here</a>:</p>
<p>In addition to solving the initial&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;problem Mark Lance and
Sydney Levy at the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html">New APPS
blog</a>&nbsp;point
out&nbsp;that this has some quite interesting effects on the nature of
discourse through the HMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is most interesting about the HM is the way that it shapes the
time and space of a discourse. &nbsp;Of course the most obvious feature
is that it slows things down. &nbsp;Everything is said twice. &nbsp;This is a
mixed blessing, no doubt, stretching out already long consensus
meetings. &nbsp;But at the same time, we must remember that we are
dealing with a huge, diverse crowd of people, many of whom are
completely new to the very idea of directly democratic
decision-making, and none of whom have much experience with this
group. &nbsp;So slowing things down and repeating everything that is said
before it is possible to respond also functions to draw people in
and lends an air of seriousness to the comments of others.</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice eliminates side-conversations. &nbsp;If you
participate in the HM, you have to listen so that you can repeat.
&nbsp;You can't be chatting snarkily with your neighbor, or even focusing
on a text. &nbsp;Neither can folks talk over one another as they could
if, say, everyone was mic-ed electronically. &nbsp;The HM can only repeat
one thing at a time. &nbsp;So there is a built in technological
imperative of waiting one's turn.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>HM as a practice seems to function to &quot;decenter&quot; conversation in
large groups. &nbsp;You don't have to be on the stage, at the mic, or in
front to be a part of the conversation of the whole. &nbsp;And even in
the most inclusive groups, the process of coming up to the front
will be disproportionate intimidating to some and, &nbsp;in the case of
some disabilities, physically difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HMs on the face of it seems to address the classic problem that people
aren't really listening if they're working out what they're going to say
next by keeping the audience tasked on repeating the current
message.&nbsp;While someone with an electronic mic is addressing a passive
(and non-tasked) audience, they might disengage and begin
side-conversations if they find the speaker uninteresting, or challenge
the speaker for control of the sound-space by shouting or booing.&nbsp;A
tasked crowd is less able to do these things[1. Another possible factor
is that HMs are imperfect methods of&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;and so can't tolerate
as much other noise, and so people are obliged to be quieter to let it
work at all].&nbsp;This raises a question: as the form of the human mic
requires people to take part in other people's words, what do people do
when they disagree with the message?&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef01539361fc5a970b">Dan
Kervick</a>
gives a possible answer:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;At least at the GA I attended, it seemed to be understood that
you&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;try to repeat even those words you disagreed with.
People were repeating words even as they were giving down twinkles
of disapproval. However, even while repeating the words, you might
not say them with much enthusiasm. Sometimes people would repeat the
words fully, but in a &quot;yada, yada, yada ...&quot; tone of voice. The
force and enthusiasm element of the repeated words seems itself to
be part of the consensus-building aspect of the assembly discourse.
The speaker's rhetorical direction is influenced in some directions
and away from others by the audible and continuous rising and
falling of the assembly's support, and by the twinkles. [...] one
guy got very vulgar and self-indulgent, and the repetition flagged
in energy and took on a tone of &quot;C'mon man, stop being an ass.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This might not be universal but in this case rather than cancelling or
drowning out the original speaker, people who are part of the microphone
instead <em>modulated</em>&nbsp;the original voice to express their opinion- the
message and dissent to the message become one and the same thing. This
means it isn't content-neutral as a medium, but also that people calling
it &quot;the people's mic&quot; aren't being entirely silly, as there's an extent
to which the crowd can imbue&nbsp;a statement with their own feelings about
that statement (although it clearly can't apply past the people taking
part).</p>
<p>In addition to the decentering point made
above&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef0154373e0ae7970c">some</a>in
the comments at APPS make the point that this is a form of amplification
that's slower and so friendlier to those who might not otherwise want to
step up and speak, but at Occupy Patriarchy Lucinda Marshall argues that
the human mic <a class="reference external" href="http://occupypatriarchy.org/2011/11/16/empowering-the-feminist-voice-at-occupy-confronting-the-silencing-of-mic-check-and-other-misogynies-in-the-occupy-movement/">isn't&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;that
empowering</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Listening&nbsp;to people yell, “Mic Check!” at Occupy locations
throughout the country, it is hard not to observe that those with
the loudest voices are the ones who really get heard with this
system, and those voices usually are male baritones.&nbsp; Talking to
women here in Washington and also reading reports from elsewhere, it
is clear that many women find this system of having to yell at the
top of your lungs to be one that is an uncomfortable way to
communicate and participate.&nbsp; Some women report being harassed when
they speak, and even of mics being grabbed from them.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;universal&nbsp;experience but it's a problem that
should qualify descriptions of HM's democratic virtue - &nbsp;for all its
merits it is as heart a means of amplification and that leaves it
vulnerable&nbsp;to existing disparities in voice.&nbsp;Still, it's a method that
has potential to enhance the deliberativeness of public conversation and
open up and democratize (to some extent) the sound-space, and so is far
more than the simple yelling it might appear to be at first.</p>
<p>Given this understanding of what the HMs are supposed to do, it becomes
clear that some groups aren't really using them correctly. Case in
point, &nbsp;a&nbsp;group of protesters at Cambridge University used what they
claimed was a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.defendeducation.co.uk/go-home-david-an-epistle-to-david-willetts">people's
mic</a>&quot;
to <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2011/11/22/selfish-and-deluded/#comments">shut-down a David Willetts
event</a>,
but if it was it's a much poorer conception of the mic than the one
emerging as their aim wasn't to conduct discussion but to close it down,
not opening up the sound-space but filling with white noise to make it
unusable.&nbsp;As the form of the human mic becomes better established it'll
be interesting to see if it keeps its original deliberative spirit.</p>

					<p>“It's like when we used to let kings take over from their fathers:
that's the craziest rule that ever existed. If the king dies they let
his kid be the king - what are the odds that he's not going to be a
piece of shit? That's one of the weirdest things that we've ever done as
a race of people.” &nbsp;- Louis C.K.</p>
<p>I’ll confess I wasn’t that excited when it was announced they’re finally
getting round to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544">ending male primogeniture for the
monarchy</a>. While it’s good in
principle in the sense that it’s absurd and sexist to say that a
second-born son is going to be a better ruler than a first-born
daughter, it’s also a bit absurd to say the first-born is inherently
going to be better at the job than the second-born. After a bit more
thought though, I realised that if you look at it from the other
direction (who it keeps off the throne) it actually makes a lot of sense
as a method of reducing violent&nbsp;political&nbsp;conflict.</p>
<p>If we imagine a different situation where an out-going king chose one of
their children on the basis of temperament and competency, this would
for many years introduce uncertainty about who the next king would be.
Uncertainty raises the potential power of factions as they angle behind
various contenders which in turn increases the probability of violence.
By introducing criteria for a ‘good king’ it would also make it more
likely that outsiders would try to make a case that they
better&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;the criteria than any of the heirs on offer, which again,
increases the likelihood of violence. Always sticking with the
first-born means you don't have to judge on any other criteria, and the
order of&nbsp;succession&nbsp;will change as few times as possible[1. To bring
this back to male primogeniture, because swapping heirs from a girl to a
boy increases the number of order changes, on the face of it it's a bad
thing - but if the fundamental concern is stability and there's a
substantial faction that would back a male heir over a female heir
anyway, there's nothing to be gained by a system
that&nbsp;legitimized&nbsp;another potential faction.].&nbsp;So looking at it this way
it isn’t about selecting the right ruler, it’s about establishing norms
that disqualify everyone else. Lots of people can raise an army but
almost no one is the first-born son of the king.</p>
<p>All this was going through my head about about the same time as I was
reading the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books, which was convenient because
Martin spends an a lot of time dwelling on the problems of succession.
While the series is often quite <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/18/realpolitik_in_a_fantasy_world">politically
interesting</a>&nbsp;what
I hadn’t noticed straight-off is how methodical he is at taking apart
and examining the problem of what makes a monarch legitimate - each of
the various Kings that end up fighting over the Iron Throne in <em>Game of
Thrones</em> and <em>Clash of Kings</em> are operating on different principles of
legitimation. Because Robert and Ned have overthrown Aeron the norms
governing succession have broken down and the stage is set for people
who would ordinarily be disqualified to make a play for the throne.
Given Joffrey is illegitimate, Stannis’ claim as the younger brother of
ex-King Robert is fairly straight-forward but there is no way for Renly
to trace a claim that doesn’t involve going through Stannis first.
Instead Renly bases his claim on a charismatic populism, not that he is
the rightful heir but that he would be a better and more popular king
than everyone else is on offer. Elsewhere Robb Stark is effectively
making the case for a right of national self-determination for the
North, Joffrey’s claim is mostly already being on the throne (there’s a
lot to be said for institutional inertia) and when the Greyjoys start
making trouble, they claim their lands by right of conquest - something
that lurks in the background of everyone else’s claims is their ability
to enforce them (the throne they’re competing over is literally made of
swords after all).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all of these are incompatible (there’s no
particular reason why Renly’s populism needs to clash with Robb’s
national self-determination) but between them all they lack a common
denominator to settle the issue other than endless bloody war, that’s
exactly what happened. While saying primogeniture results in peace would
clearly be an overstatement, it definitely has its upside. It’s also
inherently unstable because of the original problem that, just as it
doesn’t have a mechanism for selecting the most fit king, it also
doesn’t have a method of weeding out unfit ones either - for each
generation debilitating mental illness is a roll of the dice, as is the
possibility that the new monarch might just be such an awful person that
they threaten the system. It’s not wonderful, but part of what makes
Westeros such a depressing place is that sometimes it might just be as
good as you're going to get.</p>
