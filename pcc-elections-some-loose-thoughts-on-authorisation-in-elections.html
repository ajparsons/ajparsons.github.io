					<p>PCC turnout&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20374139">turned out to be a historic
low</a> and this is raising some
questions about the legitimacy of elections with low turnouts. &nbsp;What
does it mean for an election if almost no-one takes part?</p>
<p>One thing that elections are claimed to do is 'authorise', but there
tends to be fuzziness on exactly what that means. The general problem
when defining what 'authorising' means in an election is that having a
definition creates the possibility of elections that fail to meet that
definition. &nbsp;One possible escape from this is to use the argument that
'authorising' collapses quickly into tacit consent, where a&nbsp;typical
series of moves might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming majority rule is valid, if more than half of a population
agree to authorize the same person, then the election has authorized
that person.&nbsp;But wait, many elections are won by people without
majorities - how can they be authorised?</p>
<p>Well, let's say that by taking part in an election, they decide to
accept the end of the process is authorised. Collectively over 50%
agree to this, the 40% winner is authorised. But wait,&nbsp;&nbsp;some
elections have less than 50% turnout! How can that count?</p>
<p>Well, by opting to live in a democratic society people agree to
abide by certain rules, which includes accepting the winner of
elections as authorized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each stage makes the claim to authorisation more flimsy (I think it's
still valid as far as the second stage) and the trouble is this
quick&nbsp;collapses into tacit consent makes all discussion of authorisation
in elections pretty much meaningless. If&nbsp;absolutely every election can
be said to authorize the winner, it really has no meaning.</p>
<p>The way out of this hole where we obviously have some elections that no
reasonable standard could call authorising is that not all elections
need to involve authorisation: elections can either be authorizing or
consultative. &nbsp;Authorising elections perform the function of the people
empowering a person/chamber to act and take decisions on their behalf,
whereas consultative elections are essentially very official polls. &nbsp;The
logic in the case of PCC elections would be roughly the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Elections can either be exercises in authorization or
consultation.</li>
<li>Not all elections achieve 50% (notably local elections and
referenda).</li>
<li>An authorised chamber has the power to delegate its authority on
certain matters to sub-chambers staffed by whatever process it
chooses, including consultative elections.</li>
<li>A chamber elected with less than 50% turnout can legitimately
take decisions if its authority is established by a superior
chamber with sufficient authorisation.</li>
<li>The same logic allows referenda with less than 50% turnout to be
acted on.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this logic, PCC elections are fine no matter how low the turnout,
as they're a consultative election - if they were appointed or picked
out of a hat, they would be equally authorised. &nbsp;The question is then if
elections with low turnout are a good or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/pcc-elections-what-price-democracy">cost
effective</a>
method of picking the right people for the job, which an interesting and
important question - but one detached from legitimacy and authorisation.</p>
<p>This passes a low bar for a definition of authorisation in that there
are some possible elections that would not be authorised, elections to
the superior chamber need to have at least 50% turnout (and as such
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Central_by-election,_2012">Manchester Central
by-election</a>
result would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;fall short).&nbsp;There is a final dodge&nbsp;available&nbsp;to
MPs in the&nbsp;British&nbsp;system - that their elections can be seen as
consultative as &nbsp;their power comes from the crown - &nbsp;but this is a bit
of a unique case and is growingly out of step with the expanded role of
the&nbsp;British&nbsp;electorate in recent decades.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just saying that one set of elections needs 50% - in
federal arrangements where different powers are sent to different
places, multiple bodies would need to be elected by authorising
elections. Likewise there'd be a strong case for requiring 50% turnout
on constitutionally required referendums. If elections have an
authorising role then turnout has to, at least sometimes, be practically
significant. How this would actually be managed practically (delay
November by-elections till May?) is a different question.</p>
