<p>During the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">AV Campaigns
evidence</a>
for the Scottish Affairs Committee, David Mowat (Conservative
MP)&nbsp;brought up in passing the idea that devo-max could involve an
element of reduction of&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;seats in&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;in exchange for
powers, an idea that's appearing in a few places (just a few examples,
this&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ditchley.co.uk/page/384/annual-lecture-xlvii.htm">speech</a>&nbsp;by
John Major and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">this
article</a>
in the&nbsp;Scotsman) and I thought it was worth branching off this
discussion into a new post.</p>
<p>At one level the position is understandable,&nbsp;reducing seats was how
historically devolution used to work with a reduction in Irish seats
when home rule was introduced in 1921.&nbsp;The idea that seat allocation was
related to national status received more&nbsp;systematic&nbsp;backing at the 1944
Speaker's Convention where the principle was agreed that there was a
case for &quot;substantial representation&quot; of a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;nation beyond what
mathematical divisions would provide.</p>
<p>However now the principle of electoral equality has completely swept
this approach away.</p>
<p>To trace the most&nbsp;official&nbsp;examples, the idea of reducing Scottish and
Welsh seats pops up several times in the Justice Committee
Report&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmjust/529/529i.pdf">&quot;Devolution: A Decade
On&quot;</a>&nbsp;and
the most precise formulation is cited from a Constitution Unit Report by
Robert Hazell: &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/publications/tabs/unit-publications/141.pdf">Towards a New Constitutional Settlement: An Agenda for
Gordon Brownâ€™s First 100 Days and
Beyond</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One partial solution Gordon Brown could consider is to harmonise the
electoral quotas of the four UK territories, ending English
under-representation, or even to reduce the representation of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to two-thirds that of
England*.</p>
<p>*This solution has historic precedent in that during the operation
of the Northern Ireland Parliament (1922-72) Northern Ireland had 12
MPs, &nbsp;rather than the 18 its population demanded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Justice Committee Report is a little sly in this respect, reframing
this as:</p>
<blockquote>
The latter approach was taken when the 1922 Parliament of Northern
Ireland was created, and Northern Ireland MPs were reduced to
twelve. In 2005 the number of Scottish MPs was reduced from 72 to
59. (pp. 61-62)</blockquote>
<p>The implication being that the 2005 reduction is another example of the
principle at work in the Northern Ireland example when it's actually
just a delayed&nbsp;consequence&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Scotland Act 1998, which I'd argue is
working under quite different principles.</p>
<p>Now in a crude way the Act could be seen as being a 'seats for powers'
transaction as it both create a devolved body and decreases seats (that
link &nbsp;is made pretty explicitly by that piece in
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">Scotsman</a>),
but the method it uses to do so is significant.</p>
<p>The reduction in seats removes the minimum of 71 seats and a
separate&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;quota, ending over-representation of Scotland - but
the method used more&nbsp;represents a principle of electoral equality
by&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/86">syncing the Scottish&nbsp;electoral&nbsp;quota with the English
quota</a>,
something that was repeated and taken further with<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/part/2">&nbsp;the creation of a
UK-wide quota</a>&nbsp;by
the&nbsp;Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011.</p>
<p>The trend through these changes has been an effective reduction of seats
in devolved regions (or will be if the current boundary proposals are
ever passed), but the justifying principle in these cases was &quot;one
person, one vote&quot; not &quot;seats for powers&quot;.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;successive&nbsp;change has
been in favour of greater and stricter stress being giving
to&nbsp;mathematical equality on constituency apportionment, so to at this
point give Scotland less representation because of greater devolution
would be a step backwards.</p>
<p>Although there's historical&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;it's worth considering that how we
understand seats and apportionment has undergone&nbsp;enormous&nbsp;shifts since
1921.&nbsp;Today the idea that national representation should be considered
is completely lacking from the law governing apportionment.&nbsp;It's also
not at all clear it resolves the problems it's supposed to address. Is
the West Lothian question really resolved by slightly fewer Scottish MPs
voting on English matters?&nbsp;Similarly, on matters like defence and
foreign affairs, there's no particular reason why Scottish voices should
matter less on the issues they would still return MPs on.</p>
<p>As a compromise to save the union it could be a short-lived one. &nbsp;In
answer to a question on&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">his
presentation</a>
at the Constitution Unit <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan
Trench</a> put forward that
devo-max might be an unstable position as foreign policy can often be a
wedge issue &nbsp;- would this situation be better or worse if Scotland had a
legitimate&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;of unequal representation in crafting that policy
added to it?</p>
<p>But on the practical side assuming an 'English votes on English issues'
rule, Scottish MPs would be left with far less to do (especially if
their ability to sit on committees is restricted) and their non-voting
functions probably could be done by fewer MPs.&nbsp;If so reducing their
number would seem to be a good idea not only to avoid waste, but to
ensure the job is still active enough to attract good candidates. But
how can this be done while still respecting voter equality?</p>
<p>The solution is to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;the idea of an MP's vote from their physical
person.&nbsp;Scottish voters are entitled to have their votes weighed the
same as those in the other nations - but Scottish MPs don't need to have
the same voting power as other MPs. The voting power of Scottish MPs
could be increased to&nbsp;allow both a reduction in numbers and also
preserve&nbsp;mathematical&nbsp;equality (for a reduction of 2/3 this would give
Scottish MPs a vote worth one and a half their current vote, and so on).</p>
<p>Weighted voting isn't a new idea in principle but it's one that's rarely
been used in the UK - I think it's a good one to think more about in
this case as it allows respect for both voter equality and the fact that
more devolution will have practical effects at Westminster.</p>
