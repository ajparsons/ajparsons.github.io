you</a>.)</p>
<p>The first installement of Charlie Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-mirror/">Black
Mirror</a> is, if
nothing else, clever.&nbsp;The name of the anthology&nbsp;itself is clever, being
both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&nbsp;indulge&nbsp;their darker selves. &nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&nbsp;massacre.&nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&quot;)&nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.</p>
<p>I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&nbsp;Chris Applegate <a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp">points
out</a> the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf">Guardian Screen Burn
column</a>&nbsp;(
p191)&nbsp;in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.</p>
</div><div><p>The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div><p>This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.</p>
<p>In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.</p>
<p>UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html">used on the BBC
website</a>).&nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&nbsp;that their&nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.</p>
</div><div><p>That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media">in promotion of Black
Mirror</a>:</p>

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div><p>But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&nbsp;A&nbsp;longer&nbsp;stretch&nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:</p>

<div><p>What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&nbsp;In this sense it's a&nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.</p>
<p>Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&quot;</p>
<p>You pay the licence fee, you decide.</p>
