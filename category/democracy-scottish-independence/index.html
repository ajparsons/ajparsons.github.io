					<p>Something caught my eye in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Agreement-final-for-signing.pdf">draft section 30
order</a>
to empower the Scottish Parliament to pass&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;on
an&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum:</p>
<blockquote>
[4 (2)] In those provisions as applied by this article, references,
however expressed, to a person or body designated under section 108
[of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]&nbsp;are to be
read as references to a person or body designated under an Act of
the Scottish Parliament for the purposes of an independence
referendum as representing those campaigning for a particular
outcome in relation to the question in the referendum.</blockquote>
<p>This in interesting because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">section
108</a>&nbsp;gives
the power to appoint&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaigns (who gain
certain&nbsp;financial&nbsp;assistance, access to broadcast and freepost) to the
Electoral Commission - instead this is indicating the Scottish
Parliament will have the ability to directly&nbsp;designate&nbsp;campaigns for the
respective sides.&nbsp;As there's yet to be a case where there was serious
competition between two groups for the same designated status this seem
relatively&nbsp;harmless, although technically this would also allow one
campaign to be&nbsp;designated&nbsp;without the other (seems unlikely).&nbsp;The
Scottish Parliament could of course pass this back to the Electoral
Commission when they come to legislate.</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp;The memorandum of agreement seems to be stating that the
Electoral Commission should retain its role of 'designating lead
campaign organisations' which makes the above curious. I suspect in the
grand scheme of things it's doing absolutely nothing, but I'm just not
sure why it's there at all.</p>
<p>4.1 (a) in the s 30 order directly refers to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/127">s 127 of
PPERA</a>,
which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
A broadcaster shall not include in its broadcasting services any
referendum campaign broadcast made on behalf of any person or body
other than one designated in respect of the referendum in question
<strong>under section 108</strong>.</blockquote>
<div><p>&nbsp;And I'm wondering if 4.2 is then just being over&nbsp;cautious&nbsp;in relation
to this. If the Electoral Commission retains its designation powers,
those groups will be designated by s 108 and be counted under that
anyway. If that's the explanation, then 4.2 isn't needed at all and is
actually transferring more than they intended to the Scottish
Parliament, allowing it to designate extra groups that could make
election broadcasts and mailshots (not a hugely useful power but hey).</p>

					<p>It's starting to look very much like the voting&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;will be
extended in&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;for the independence referendum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19900973">to include sixteen
and seventeen
year-olds</a>.&nbsp;I've
written before on the <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">Votes at 16
argument</a>
(shorter version: most argument for it are&nbsp;unsatisfying, interesting
approach might be&nbsp;graduated&nbsp;and fractional voting rights far below
16)&nbsp;but while I'm posting abandoned avenues from my dissertation I
thought it was worth including the section I wrote on the idea of
expanding the&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;for referendums, before giving up on that side
of the project because it seemed a bit unlikely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another possible consideration for referendums not mentioned in the
Electoral Commission report is if it’s intended for the referendum
electorate to be different (larger or smaller) from that of the
normal electorate.</p>
<p>For example, expanding the franchise to include
those 16 and 17 year-olds is something under active consideration
(but probably doubtful) for the Scottish independence referendum and
a former civil servant indicated at the Constitution Unit talk on
Scottish Independence that similar measures were considered (but
ultimately rejected) in terms of expanding the electorate were made
for the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum (in that case to
holidaymakers and those abroad).</p>
<p>When asked by the Scottish Affairs
Committee on how long the process of preparing for an expanded
electorate would take Andrew Scallan (Director of Electoral
Administration at The Electoral Commission) spent a long time not
wanting to give a precise answer as to how long the process of
expanding the registers would take (more than a week, less than a
year) but did suggest the best scenario would be legislation in the
summer followed by a household canvas in the Autumn and at other
times of year the process might be more difficult/result in a less
complete register.</p>
<p>In terms of otherwise unexplored issues of
referendum time, this could be interesting but involves quite an
expansion of scope into discussion of electoral registers
(especially in terms of the pending switchover to individual
electoral registration) for what is likely to remain a hypothetical
situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So opps on that, but practical considerations still interesting. This
might also affect future UK referendums because it diminishes the
precedent of referendums only using existing electorates - so in future
referendums we could have similar moves to try and include other un-able
to vote groups.&nbsp;Should non-EU citizens vote in a UK referendum on
leaving the EU? &nbsp;Strangely that might not even be a&nbsp;hypothetical, as EU
citizens are part of the Holyrood electorate they should be able to vote
in this one - and whether the new Scotland would automatically be an EU
member <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9303587/European-Commission-Separate-Scotland-forced-to-reapply-for-EU-membership.html">is still up for
debate</a>.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;something I hadn't picked up on before is that this isn't the only
movement on the subject in Scotland, since last year the crofting
elections franchise&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/456/regulation/4/made">extends to 16 year
olds</a>.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motti82/3599285646/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2477/3599285646_c4c8534cef.jpg" /></a>One thing that's not being appreciated enough (because it's
only exciting to a certain kind of wonk) is how the debates about a
Scottish Independence referendum are systematically going through every
disputed concept in the idea of elections. When is the vote? About what?
How will they vote? Especially disputed is the question of who should
vote: All affected interests? By geography? By blood? And now there's
also the question of if people younger than 18 should be given a say in
their national future. If this goes anywhere, it would be the first UK
referendum which expands rather than contracts the electorate (and would
require the development of a separate voting register for this election
which might be interesting).</p>
<p>The one thing still off-limit is breaking the idea that all voters
should count equally - a rule I'll argue further down that breaking
would actually provide quite a neat solution to the problem of lowering
the voting age - but first let's go into the normal arguments for a bit.
Here we have Angela Constance <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/2012/02/01/should-16-and-17-year-olds-vote-in-the-referendum/">making the case
for</a>
letting 16 -and 17-year-olds vote:</p>
<blockquote>
After all, if a 16 year old in Scotland can join the army, get
married and pay taxes – surely he or she should be able to have a
say in this country’s future? That is why in the consultation Your
Scotland, Your Referendum, we are seeking views on extending the
right to vote in this referendum to 16 and 17 year olds who are
eligible to be included on the electoral register.</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual trio brought up to demonstrate the unfairness of the
current voting age. The object here is to show that we are in some way
being inconsistent in handling the maturity of 16 year olds without
relying on the slippery slope of 'maturity'. In Scotland the marriage
thing holds (In England and Wales there's a parental consent requirement
below 18) but the army item has gotten more tenuous as although 16 year
olds can join the army <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defencemanagement.com/feature_story.asp?id=15592">they're not actually allowed to deploy anywhere
till they're
18</a>.</p>
<p>The tax argument is worth going into. The idea that there's a connection
between taxation and representation is an old one but not necessarily a
particularly good one to demonstrate inconsistency - being consistent on
it would require us to do far more than allow 16-year-olds to vote. For
a start, we actually let children pay taxes far earlier than 16, any
time a child saves up and buys anything with VAT they're tax-payers.
True at 16 someone can work full time and pay income tax, but there's no
real reason to connect this kind of tax to the franchise and no other.
From the other end we don't take away the right to vote from adult
unemployed people or those in full-time education who similarly have the
potential to be tax-payers but aren't. To be consistent, if it's the
ability to pay tax that's important we must enfranchise anyone who can
earn and spend anything, or if we are treating income tax as a special
case then we need to disenfranchise anyone who is not paying income tax
(in which case the Lib Dem policy of raising the personal threshold
wouldn't be a way of relieving the tax burden on the poorest but a
sneaky way of disenfranchising them).</p>
<p>What this argument is basically getting at is the idea that we have a
norm for granting a set of rights at 16 and voting rights should be
included in it. This is a helpful argument for advocates of lowering the
voting age because it allows an appeal to precedent and doesn't rely
directly on the nebulous idea of 'maturity' - a problematic idea because
there's inevitably only a small difference between each age cohort
making it hard to draw the process to a stop (if we let 18 year olds,
why not 17? And if them why not 16? And if them, why not... and so on).</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that it's hard to see why this logic doesn't
also apply to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/kccentral/yourvoice/yourrights/yourrightsat18.aspx">any other
right</a>
gained at 18. The basic challenge of 'we grant right X at 16, how is it
just that we grant right Y at 18?' applies to all of them. If children
are considered mature enough to have opinions on keeping Trident, why
shouldn't they be allowed to buy fireworks? Taken to its conclusion this
is saying is that adulthood begins at 16, not that children should vote.</p>
<p>There's not necessarily anything wrong with this idea, a society based
on this would be different but not unthinkable, but accepting this puts
an end to the idea of graduated maturity. <a class="reference external" href="http://ann.sagepub.com/content/633/1/141">Andrew Rehfeld
argues</a> that the defining
feature of childhood maturity isn't that it is or isn't present but that
it is 'in development' and I think this chimes with how many people
instinctively feel about the subject. Many 16 year olds are on average
probably mature enough to be citizens, but 18 year olds are on average
more so and 14-year-olds on average less so - hence a structure that
grants legal rights at intervals and removes qualifications on rights as
a person ages seems to fit nicely into this. So given this, how should
voting rights be handled? Highest bundle? Lowest? Rehfeld leans on the
idea of California state senator John Vasconcellos, who argued that
rather than debate at which point we turn on voting rights, we should do
it gradually and give fractional votes to citizens under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Rehfeld actually goes far further than most child voting supporters, not
simply arguing that 16-year-olds should have half a vote until they turn
18, but that we should go far lower and each year from 12 a person
should gain 1/7 of a vote until they have their full vote at 18
(Vasconcellos's fractions were <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Wheels_for_Citizenship">different but same basic
idea</a>).
The basic idea of gradualism I think is a good one because it sidesteps
the problem of a 'race to the bottom' above as this approach reflects
differences in maturity rather than similarities.&nbsp;Practically the vote
count would be different but not&nbsp;unmanageable&nbsp;and could still be done
with a hand count - at it's most basic you could use&nbsp;separate&nbsp;registers
for each birth year, colour-code the voting slips and then count these
votes&nbsp;separate&nbsp;from the main piles. Counting the different cohorts in
series would add little difficulty over simply increasing the number of
voters.</p>
<p>Now that some people should have greater voting power than others is a
commonly-had and commonly-rejected idea. Ultimately that each person has
one vote is a compromise, as any other scheme arguing that certain
citizens are wiser and so should have greater voting powers would not be
generally accepted and so would undermine rather than enrich the
democratic process. I think children are a special case in this sense as
the fractional vote represents a process rather than permanent division.
It's not an argument that a certain race or gender's votes are worth
less, or that any particular&nbsp;qualification&nbsp;should give more voting power
- simply that children start off immature and progress towards maturity
and they should have a voting power that reflects this reality.&nbsp;It
allows for what I think is a reasonably common sense view on the
maturity of children to be expressed, while at the same time recognizing
that children represent real interests (that are distinct from any other
group) and should have a say in matters.</p>
<p>Even as a reduced voting block this would still introduce
a&nbsp;sizeable&nbsp;number of people to the electorate so the result is far from
a token vote, and as a result children would grow and be socialized into
citizenship rather than having it thrust on them all at once. This is a
more radical approach than votes at 16, but I think it ultimately
accomplishes the same aims better and - rather than creating a new
voting age with the same justifications waiting in the wings to lower it
again - would create a future-proof framework for dealing with child
voters. Best case, this gives us a political system more tuned to the
needs and concerns of the young (and by proxy, future generations) and
more children who enter adulthood as politically aware individuals.
Worst case, we add a few more voters to the large number who already
have no idea what they're doing. &nbsp;On the basis of that highly slanted
weighing up of the facts, it'd be silly not to think about it.</p>

					<p>The<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16561604">BBC
reports</a>
that Westminster is claiming a Scottish&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum wouldn't
be able to use the full electoral roll, which seems a bit strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: &quot;The UK government has
set out very clearly that the Scottish government cannot legislate
lawfully for a referendum with its current powers.</p>
<p>&quot;The full electoral register can only be used for specific purposes
such as the general or Holyrood elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The legal position is clear - if the SNP attempts to go ahead with
its own referendum then it will be nothing more than an opinion
poll, with a million Scots unable to be asked for their view.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true this means many potential voters could be excluded as they're
not on the&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;available (reduced) register. As a layman I've had a
quick skim of some of the acts related to the electoral register and
according to the explanatory note of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1872/note/made">Representation of the People
(Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations
2002</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A copy of the full version of the register may not be supplied by a
registration officer otherwise than in accordance with an enactment
(which, by virtue of the definition in inserted regulation 92(2),
includes subordinate legislation) including the principal
Regulations (inserted regulation 94(3)).</blockquote>
<p>The effect of which includes an enactment to be &nbsp;'any provision of, or
of any instrument made under, an&nbsp;Act of the Scottish Parliament' via
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/2/contents">Representation of the People Act
2000</a>. &nbsp;Which,
again I might be misreading, I take to mean the Scottish Parliament can
in principle have referenda using the electoral roll. If they can use it
for even a non-binding question about a reserved power is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/nov/08/uk-supreme-court-scottish-independence">contested</a>.</p>
<p>As Matt Qvortrup&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/dr_matt_qvortrup_scotland_does_not_need_permission_to_go_it_alone_1_2047506">sort of
argues</a>in
the Scotsman, the international recognition of self-determination (which
I think is less strong than he suggests, but going with it) would likely
mean in the event that Scotland holds a democratically legitimate but
illegal referendum, it would likely have to be recognised by Westminster
- which is why moves to&nbsp;de-legitimize&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;vote by arguing
people will be excluded make sense, and as I've said before the SNP
should be careful to avoid <a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">ambiguous questions that give rise to these

However a spokesperson for the Scottish government rejected Mr

the appropriate legislation was passed at Holyrood, ensuring full

<blockquote>
<p>One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.</p>
<p>Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &quot;independence lite&quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.</p>
<p>There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Kellner of YouGov has a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">good run
down</a>
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html">they're leaving a space open for it to
return</a>,
and ERS Scotland<a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases">is advocating a different
form</a> of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.</p>
<p>One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;independence?</p>
<p>One answer would be that the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.</p>
<p>There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&nbsp;information&nbsp;on if people would
prefer&nbsp;independence&nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.</p>
<p>If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Would you like a change to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Would you prefer&nbsp;independence or devo-max?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.</p>
<p>“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.</p>
<p>From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&nbsp;political&nbsp;stitch-up in&nbsp;Westminster).&nbsp;This leaves either&nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.</p>
