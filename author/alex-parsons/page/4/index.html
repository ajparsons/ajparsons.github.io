					<p>PCC turnout&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20374139">turned out to be a historic
low</a> and this is raising some
questions about the legitimacy of elections with low turnouts. &nbsp;What
does it mean for an election if almost no-one takes part?</p>
<p>One thing that elections are claimed to do is 'authorise', but there
tends to be fuzziness on exactly what that means. The general problem
when defining what 'authorising' means in an election is that having a
definition creates the possibility of elections that fail to meet that
definition. &nbsp;One possible escape from this is to use the argument that
'authorising' collapses quickly into tacit consent, where a&nbsp;typical
series of moves might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming majority rule is valid, if more than half of a population
agree to authorize the same person, then the election has authorized
that person.&nbsp;But wait, many elections are won by people without
majorities - how can they be authorised?</p>
<p>Well, let's say that by taking part in an election, they decide to
accept the end of the process is authorised. Collectively over 50%
agree to this, the 40% winner is authorised. But wait,&nbsp;&nbsp;some
elections have less than 50% turnout! How can that count?</p>
<p>Well, by opting to live in a democratic society people agree to
abide by certain rules, which includes accepting the winner of
elections as authorized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each stage makes the claim to authorisation more flimsy (I think it's
still valid as far as the second stage) and the trouble is this
quick&nbsp;collapses into tacit consent makes all discussion of authorisation
in elections pretty much meaningless. If&nbsp;absolutely every election can
be said to authorize the winner, it really has no meaning.</p>
<p>The way out of this hole where we obviously have some elections that no
reasonable standard could call authorising is that not all elections
need to involve authorisation: elections can either be authorizing or
consultative. &nbsp;Authorising elections perform the function of the people
empowering a person/chamber to act and take decisions on their behalf,
whereas consultative elections are essentially very official polls. &nbsp;The
logic in the case of PCC elections would be roughly the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Elections can either be exercises in authorization or
consultation.</li>
<li>Not all elections achieve 50% (notably local elections and
referenda).</li>
<li>An authorised chamber has the power to delegate its authority on
certain matters to sub-chambers staffed by whatever process it
chooses, including consultative elections.</li>
<li>A chamber elected with less than 50% turnout can legitimately
take decisions if its authority is established by a superior
chamber with sufficient authorisation.</li>
<li>The same logic allows referenda with less than 50% turnout to be
acted on.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this logic, PCC elections are fine no matter how low the turnout,
as they're a consultative election - if they were appointed or picked
out of a hat, they would be equally authorised. &nbsp;The question is then if
elections with low turnout are a good or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/pcc-elections-what-price-democracy">cost
effective</a>
method of picking the right people for the job, which an interesting and
important question - but one detached from legitimacy and authorisation.</p>
<p>This passes a low bar for a definition of authorisation in that there
are some possible elections that would not be authorised, elections to
the superior chamber need to have at least 50% turnout (and as such
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Central_by-election,_2012">Manchester Central
by-election</a>
result would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;fall short).&nbsp;There is a final dodge&nbsp;available&nbsp;to
MPs in the&nbsp;British&nbsp;system - that their elections can be seen as
consultative as &nbsp;their power comes from the crown - &nbsp;but this is a bit
of a unique case and is growingly out of step with the expanded role of
the&nbsp;British&nbsp;electorate in recent decades.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just saying that one set of elections needs 50% - in
federal arrangements where different powers are sent to different
places, multiple bodies would need to be elected by authorising
elections. Likewise there'd be a strong case for requiring 50% turnout
on constitutionally required referendums. If elections have an
authorising role then turnout has to, at least sometimes, be practically
significant. How this would actually be managed practically (delay
November by-elections till May?) is a different question.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/TWD-game-cover-286x300.jpg" />I've been a fan of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/">Telltale</a> since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Lw312RrXk">Sam &amp;
Max</a> games and in recent
games started to notice a trend towards games that had some
consideration of ethical issues. In their <em>Jurassic Park</em> game
characters have a lengthy debate about the morality of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency">lysine
contingency</a>,
and in their <em>Back to the Future</em> game a version of Emmett Brown
pointedly asks what gives you (Marty) the right to use time travel to
decide which people should and shouldn't be living happy lives in 1985.
While I ended up being disappointed by the game&nbsp;ending in both cases, I
was impressed at how Telltale had found ways to mine&nbsp;the world of
the&nbsp;franchises they're playing in&nbsp;and ask interesting ethical questions
about them. While the show version of <em>The Walking Dead</em> has issues, I
was interested to see what Telltale would do with a world that was
essentially always about making difficult ethical choices.</p>
<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> game exists in roughly the same world as the comics
and TV show&nbsp;(not aware if it's considered in the same canon as either,
although there is some character overlap) where the world is overrun by
a zombie&nbsp;apocalypse and the driving narrative force is dealing with&nbsp;how
people exist with uncomfortable decisions and the end of
civilisation.&nbsp;Gameplay is relatively simple, the majority of the game is
spent going between cut-scenes and dialogue options, where&nbsp;your choices
of dialogue will affect your relationship with other characters,
affecting future dialogue.&nbsp;There are also scenes where there is freedom
to roam and accomplish traditional point-and-click game tasks, or&nbsp;action
sequences with Quick Time events.</p>
<p>At the start of each episode the game tells you: '<em>This game series
adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.'</em>
However what becomes apparent quite quickly is that your ability to make
choices that drastically affect the story is quite limited but what I
found especially interesting after playing the first few episodes was
how this made the game better at being an 'ethics game' than an
endlessly branching story might be.</p>
<p>To take a typical choice, there's a situation where you can choose to
act morally, but this will cause you to have less time to gather
supplies. However aside from some dialogue about this the supplies
themselves mean nothing, this isn't a game with health bars and you are
physically able to carry out the same tasks no matter how much your
character has eaten.&nbsp;Similarly a decision whether or not to take
supplies from a possible abandoned car doesn't matter, your group will
survive and be alive and well in the next episode anyway.</p>
<p>To an extent this is making lives easier for the developers who don't
have to track and script every possible divergent fork.&nbsp;Unlike some text
adventure games it won't severely punish you hours down the line from a
decision made early on (and most decisions that cause divergent paths
collapse to the same outcome, if through slightly different means), all
death events are caused by&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;button mashing and there are
very few places where you can through dialogue choices lead to a 'game
over'. However, practical&nbsp;considerations&nbsp;aren't the only ones here and I
think the general inflexibility of the game world goes&nbsp;some way&nbsp;towards
making this an interestingly ethics-based game.</p>
<p>In trying to work out how to account for ethical choices in a game like
this I was reminded of a season two episode of <em>Angel</em> -
'<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(Angel)">Epiphany</a>'. In
this episode&nbsp;Angel, who had seen himself as a pivotal player in the
battle between good and evil, realises what a small player he really is
and decides that if the big ends are unchangeable then how he chooses to
act is the only thing that matters -&nbsp;&quot;If nothing we do matters, then all
that matters is what we do&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a credo that carries over well to The Walking Dead.&nbsp;Your
character simply does not have the power to influence the world around
him to huge degrees. We, as players, know that the world is on rails and
certain events are inevitable regardless of our choices but the
reactions of other characters are flexible enough to our choices that
there is a sense of immersion and weight to choices we make. &nbsp;The key
question here is if your character is powerless to prevent or control
his fate, does it make choosing to behave ethically more or less
meaningful?</p>
<p>My thinking is that this lack of control takes away a lot of traditional
gaming thinking from the player. If it was possible to prevent every
death, there'd be incentive for people to see each death as a failure
and constantly reload in search of that '100% complete' achievement (à
la&nbsp;<em>Heavy Rain</em>).&nbsp;By keeping choices about choosing sides (and
aligning yourself with various other characters), the game sidesteps the
problem of creating right and wrong answers to puzzles - there are
simply choices you make. And if these choices have no effect on 'game
score' - then there is no disincentive to role play.</p>
<p>How do you decide which four out of ten people will get food?&nbsp;You can
play it by who you want to keep 'on side' but as established that
doesn't matter-matter &nbsp;- by taking away practical gaming considerations
the game makes you consider what you would do in those circumstances.
&nbsp;When the game offered me a choice of keeping the last piece of food for
myself, I&nbsp;was stuck on that decision for a minute or so - without
in-game&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;our own sense of ethics can be fully engaged.</p>
<p>However, the flip side is the question of can a game that doesn't make
you suffer for picking morally better
but&nbsp;practically&nbsp;disadvantageous&nbsp;decisions really be asking you to make
meaningful decisions?&nbsp;To which I'd answer that meaningful in the game
and meaningful to the player are quite different things.&nbsp;By turning off
gamer logic, the game changes the basis you make decisions on. You're
not choosing which version of the game you want to be playing an hour
down the line but are forced to make decisions based on personal
considerations.</p>
<p>So while <em>The Walking Dead</em> may in some senses be far more linear than
it's described as, the linear plot creates room for an interesting kind
of sandbox ethics game. Even if most choices don't matter to the story,
they do matter to you.</p>

					<p>Something caught my eye in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Agreement-final-for-signing.pdf">draft section 30
order</a>
to empower the Scottish Parliament to pass&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;on
an&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum:</p>
<blockquote>
[4 (2)] In those provisions as applied by this article, references,
however expressed, to a person or body designated under section 108
[of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]&nbsp;are to be
read as references to a person or body designated under an Act of
the Scottish Parliament for the purposes of an independence
referendum as representing those campaigning for a particular
outcome in relation to the question in the referendum.</blockquote>
<p>This in interesting because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">section
108</a>&nbsp;gives
the power to appoint&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaigns (who gain
certain&nbsp;financial&nbsp;assistance, access to broadcast and freepost) to the
Electoral Commission - instead this is indicating the Scottish
Parliament will have the ability to directly&nbsp;designate&nbsp;campaigns for the
respective sides.&nbsp;As there's yet to be a case where there was serious
competition between two groups for the same designated status this seem
relatively&nbsp;harmless, although technically this would also allow one
campaign to be&nbsp;designated&nbsp;without the other (seems unlikely).&nbsp;The
Scottish Parliament could of course pass this back to the Electoral
Commission when they come to legislate.</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp;The memorandum of agreement seems to be stating that the
Electoral Commission should retain its role of 'designating lead
campaign organisations' which makes the above curious. I suspect in the
grand scheme of things it's doing absolutely nothing, but I'm just not
sure why it's there at all.</p>
<p>4.1 (a) in the s 30 order directly refers to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/127">s 127 of
PPERA</a>,
which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
A broadcaster shall not include in its broadcasting services any
referendum campaign broadcast made on behalf of any person or body
other than one designated in respect of the referendum in question
<strong>under section 108</strong>.</blockquote>
<div><p>&nbsp;And I'm wondering if 4.2 is then just being over&nbsp;cautious&nbsp;in relation
to this. If the Electoral Commission retains its designation powers,
those groups will be designated by s 108 and be counted under that
anyway. If that's the explanation, then 4.2 isn't needed at all and is
actually transferring more than they intended to the Scottish
Parliament, allowing it to designate extra groups that could make
election broadcasts and mailshots (not a hugely useful power but hey).</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/245px-David_Lloyd_George-230x300.jpg" />David Cameron is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9606608/David-Cameron-Honours-for-cash-No-problem.html">reported to have
said</a>
to&nbsp;a gathering of donors at the Conservative Party conference:</p>
<blockquote>
“Look, I have no problem giving honours to donors,”&nbsp;David
Cameron&nbsp;declared. “They are doing a public service, in my view.
Otherwise, we’d have to turn to state funding of our political
parties, which would just add to our deficit and be totally
unacceptable.”</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, I find myself agreeing with him.&nbsp;Parties are
essential to the democratic system ticking over, parties need money to
run, parties need to get money from somewhere. I think there's an
excellent case for state funding of parties but if in the meantime we
have cash in one set of hands and in the other set of hands we have
honours that people like (but don't really mean that much) that seems a
fair deal.</p>
<p>There is the little snag here: selling honours is a criminal offence
under the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/72/section/1">Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act
1925</a>&nbsp;and
you have to wonder if the&nbsp;&quot;giving me money is a public good and people
should be rewarded for contributing to the public good&quot; line is really
enough not to fall foul of this. The offence was&nbsp;introduced after Lloyd
George was quite brazenly selling off&nbsp;honours&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://everything2.com/user/aneurin/writeups/Lloyd+George+and+the+Honours+Scandal">for party
funding</a>&nbsp;(his&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;went
so far as to have&nbsp;&quot;a published tariff with a knighthood being available
for £10,000, a baronetcy for £30,000, with a peerage title costing
upwards of £50,000&quot;). The big trouble is peerages as these bestow some
actual power with a seat in House of Lords - but assuming the Lords was
abolished for a minute, what's the objection? There is the perception of
corruption when rich people give things to parties and get nice things
in return, but does a knighthood really have much utility beyond feeling
quite nice?</p>
<p>A party system funding&nbsp;solely&nbsp;by the rich gives the wrong incentives but
we could refine this to give everyone an incentive to get involved:&nbsp;why
not open it up and officialise&nbsp;Cash for Honours by making the process a
lottery? People have given money into the various party pots - pick a
few pounds out and bestow a few honours that way. If you operate a few
different pots for different donation ranges, a&nbsp;fair amount will end up
with the same set of wealthy donors, but it will also introduce a chance
that everyday party supporters could be rewarded for the noble work of
ensuring our&nbsp;political&nbsp;system's wheels stay&nbsp;greased.</p>
<p>I'm being a little&nbsp;facetious here and this process would raise all kinds
of questions (a knighthood for donating to the BNP?) but I think the
core question is a good one: why is the idea of the&nbsp;government&nbsp;using its
ability to bestow honours to fund these vital democratic functions
inherently bad?</p>

					<p>Looking back on my child voting notes I remembered an argument that I
didn't touch on last time <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">I wrote about votes for
children</a>:
&nbsp;that children's different experiences alone, regardless of any question
of&nbsp;competence&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to justify&nbsp;representation.</p>
<p>What often annoys me about Votes at 16 arguments is that so many of the
arguments deployed are incredibly regressive.&nbsp;Children can pay tax, they
should vote! And we'll take away the vote from adults who don't? &nbsp;If we
lived in democracies with property requirements child voting advocates
would be arguing that 16-year-olds can own property and should vote, not
that there's something wrong with the basic idea.&nbsp;Fundamentally there's
no difference between this tax position and<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/">Ian Cowie's
idea</a>
that only those who paid more than £100 income tax should be allowed to
vote, which itself isn't a long way removed from an argument that the
rich pay for more more of the state, why shouldn't they have more of a
say?</p>
<p>British democracy has its origins in exactly this idea of a stakeholder
democracy, expanding to include any group that might threaten it from
the outside. But the real merit of democracy is that it is so disruptive
of existing norms - democracy shouldn't simply reflect other power
structures (the rich having more of a say than others, men wielding more
decision making power than women) but should work to undermine those
structures by expressing the always radical notion that
everyone&nbsp;deserves&nbsp;an equal say.</p>
<p>Children represent a distinct interest, a massive consumer of state
services (which occupy and direct a large amount of their time) and yet
the argument often deployed is that they are so like us that it would
unfair not to include them, not that they are so different we are
missing a vital voice. As <a class="reference external" href="http://chd.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/06/0907568211406756">Wall put
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]hildren may not always have as much autonomy or power as adults,
but they are every bit as different. If the purpose of democratic
representation is to respond to the fullest possible diversity of
social experiences, then it includes responding to children – and to
children’s endless diversity – just as much as it does to adults.
Indeed, children would take on a heightened status as the most
important test of being democratic, since they are more likely than
most to call for political responsiveness from the whole. <strong>Being
represented in the political sphere should not depend entirely on
how competently one can argue for one’s interests or how effectively
one can struggle against others for power. It should depend finally
on how different one’s experiences are from those of others.</strong> (p.
10)</p>
<p>The right to vote should be as expansive as possible because those
voted into office are given power over the lives of all. It should
be presumed that everyone can vote unless a compelling argument can
be provided for exclusion. Children’s right to vote is important if
elected representatives are to perform their democratic duties of
challenging historical marginalization and responding to
constituents’ fullest differences. (p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this perspective because the notion of letting children vote is
unsettling is an excellent reason to do it - it will disrupt current
power relations in a way that improve society. &nbsp;There's a fine argument
that actually, children are a different class of excluded person than
all previous examples because their immaturity is transitional - one day
they will grow up, no one is&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;excluded - but for the
'democracy as difference' argument this is hollow comfort because their
'difference' representing the child's interests is lost.&nbsp;If the blanket
inclusion this implies is too radical, there are schemes <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">that represent
children on a fractional
basis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which
are at least no worse than complete exclusion).</p>
<p>My&nbsp;personal opinion on votes at 16 has always tended towards supportive
indifference, however currently&nbsp;I'm trying to write something long on
political equality and democracy and it's been eye opening to see how
many democratic theorists are just as willing to ignore the issue
('assume a population of adults' is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical
cow</a> of democratic
theory). It's becoming increasingly hard to hold to the stance that this
is an unimportant issue, in the UK the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx">proportion of the population
under
fifteen</a>
is 18% - in Iraq and Libya it's 43%, Tanzania 45%, Uganda 48%.&nbsp;In places
where the proportion of children to adults almost approaches parity,&nbsp;how
can any account of democracy that excludes children not be severely
flawed?</p>

					<p>It's starting to look very much like the voting&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;will be
extended in&nbsp;Scotland&nbsp;for the independence referendum <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19900973">to include sixteen
and seventeen
year-olds</a>.&nbsp;I've
written before on the <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">Votes at 16
argument</a>
(shorter version: most argument for it are&nbsp;unsatisfying, interesting
approach might be&nbsp;graduated&nbsp;and fractional voting rights far below
16)&nbsp;but while I'm posting abandoned avenues from my dissertation I
thought it was worth including the section I wrote on the idea of
expanding the&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;for referendums, before giving up on that side
of the project because it seemed a bit unlikely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another possible consideration for referendums not mentioned in the
Electoral Commission report is if it’s intended for the referendum
electorate to be different (larger or smaller) from that of the
normal electorate.</p>
<p>For example, expanding the franchise to include
those 16 and 17 year-olds is something under active consideration
(but probably doubtful) for the Scottish independence referendum and
a former civil servant indicated at the Constitution Unit talk on
Scottish Independence that similar measures were considered (but
ultimately rejected) in terms of expanding the electorate were made
for the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum (in that case to
holidaymakers and those abroad).</p>
<p>When asked by the Scottish Affairs
Committee on how long the process of preparing for an expanded
electorate would take Andrew Scallan (Director of Electoral
Administration at The Electoral Commission) spent a long time not
wanting to give a precise answer as to how long the process of
expanding the registers would take (more than a week, less than a
year) but did suggest the best scenario would be legislation in the
summer followed by a household canvas in the Autumn and at other
times of year the process might be more difficult/result in a less
complete register.</p>
<p>In terms of otherwise unexplored issues of
referendum time, this could be interesting but involves quite an
expansion of scope into discussion of electoral registers
(especially in terms of the pending switchover to individual
electoral registration) for what is likely to remain a hypothetical
situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So opps on that, but practical considerations still interesting. This
might also affect future UK referendums because it diminishes the
precedent of referendums only using existing electorates - so in future
referendums we could have similar moves to try and include other un-able
to vote groups.&nbsp;Should non-EU citizens vote in a UK referendum on
leaving the EU? &nbsp;Strangely that might not even be a&nbsp;hypothetical, as EU
citizens are part of the Holyrood electorate they should be able to vote
in this one - and whether the new Scotland would automatically be an EU
member <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9303587/European-Commission-Separate-Scotland-forced-to-reapply-for-EU-membership.html">is still up for
debate</a>.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;something I hadn't picked up on before is that this isn't the only
movement on the subject in Scotland, since last year the crofting
elections franchise&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/456/regulation/4/made">extends to 16 year
olds</a>.</p>
