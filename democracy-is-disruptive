					<p>Looking back on my child voting notes I remembered an argument that I
didn't touch on last time <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">I wrote about votes for
children</a>:
&nbsp;that children's different experiences alone, regardless of any question
of&nbsp;competence&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to justify&nbsp;representation.</p>
<p>What often annoys me about Votes at 16 arguments is that so many of the
arguments deployed are incredibly regressive.&nbsp;Children can pay tax, they
should vote! And we'll take away the vote from adults who don't? &nbsp;If we
lived in democracies with property requirements child voting advocates
would be arguing that 16-year-olds can own property and should vote, not
that there's something wrong with the basic idea.&nbsp;Fundamentally there's
no difference between this tax position and<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/">Ian Cowie's
idea</a>
that only those who paid more than £100 income tax should be allowed to
vote, which itself isn't a long way removed from an argument that the
rich pay for more more of the state, why shouldn't they have more of a
say?</p>
<p>British democracy has its origins in exactly this idea of a stakeholder
democracy, expanding to include any group that might threaten it from
the outside. But the real merit of democracy is that it is so disruptive
of existing norms - democracy shouldn't simply reflect other power
structures (the rich having more of a say than others, men wielding more
decision making power than women) but should work to undermine those
structures by expressing the always radical notion that
everyone&nbsp;deserves&nbsp;an equal say.</p>
<p>Children represent a distinct interest, a massive consumer of state
services (which occupy and direct a large amount of their time) and yet
the argument often deployed is that they are so like us that it would
unfair not to include them, not that they are so different we are
missing a vital voice. As <a class="reference external" href="http://chd.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/06/0907568211406756">Wall put
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]hildren may not always have as much autonomy or power as adults,
but they are every bit as different. If the purpose of democratic
representation is to respond to the fullest possible diversity of
social experiences, then it includes responding to children – and to
children’s endless diversity – just as much as it does to adults.
Indeed, children would take on a heightened status as the most
important test of being democratic, since they are more likely than
most to call for political responsiveness from the whole. <strong>Being
represented in the political sphere should not depend entirely on
how competently one can argue for one’s interests or how effectively
one can struggle against others for power. It should depend finally
on how different one’s experiences are from those of others.</strong> (p.
10)</p>
<p>The right to vote should be as expansive as possible because those
voted into office are given power over the lives of all. It should
be presumed that everyone can vote unless a compelling argument can
be provided for exclusion. Children’s right to vote is important if
elected representatives are to perform their democratic duties of
challenging historical marginalization and responding to
constituents’ fullest differences. (p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this perspective because the notion of letting children vote is
unsettling is an excellent reason to do it - it will disrupt current
power relations in a way that improve society. &nbsp;There's a fine argument
that actually, children are a different class of excluded person than
all previous examples because their immaturity is transitional - one day
they will grow up, no one is&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;excluded - but for the
'democracy as difference' argument this is hollow comfort because their
'difference' representing the child's interests is lost.&nbsp;If the blanket
inclusion this implies is too radical, there are schemes <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">that represent
children on a fractional
basis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which
are at least no worse than complete exclusion).</p>
<p>My&nbsp;personal opinion on votes at 16 has always tended towards supportive
indifference, however currently&nbsp;I'm trying to write something long on
political equality and democracy and it's been eye opening to see how
many democratic theorists are just as willing to ignore the issue
('assume a population of adults' is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical
cow</a> of democratic
theory). It's becoming increasingly hard to hold to the stance that this
is an unimportant issue, in the UK the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx">proportion of the population
under
fifteen</a>
is 18% - in Iraq and Libya it's 43%, Tanzania 45%, Uganda 48%.&nbsp;In places
where the proportion of children to adults almost approaches parity,&nbsp;how
can any account of democracy that excludes children not be severely
flawed?</p>
