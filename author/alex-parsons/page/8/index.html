					<p>The idea of the 'human mic' was one born out of a practical necessity,
the police prevented the first OWS protests from
having&nbsp;electronic&nbsp;amplification so to compensate the mechanism of the HM
emerged, where the person currently with the 'mic' would say a short
phrase of their statement, which those around them would shout, before
the speaker moved onto the next phase and so on - there's a good example
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIK7uxBSAS0">here</a>:</p>
<p>In addition to solving the initial&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;problem Mark Lance and
Sydney Levy at the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html">New APPS
blog</a>&nbsp;point
out&nbsp;that this has some quite interesting effects on the nature of
discourse through the HMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is most interesting about the HM is the way that it shapes the
time and space of a discourse. &nbsp;Of course the most obvious feature
is that it slows things down. &nbsp;Everything is said twice. &nbsp;This is a
mixed blessing, no doubt, stretching out already long consensus
meetings. &nbsp;But at the same time, we must remember that we are
dealing with a huge, diverse crowd of people, many of whom are
completely new to the very idea of directly democratic
decision-making, and none of whom have much experience with this
group. &nbsp;So slowing things down and repeating everything that is said
before it is possible to respond also functions to draw people in
and lends an air of seriousness to the comments of others.</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice eliminates side-conversations. &nbsp;If you
participate in the HM, you have to listen so that you can repeat.
&nbsp;You can't be chatting snarkily with your neighbor, or even focusing
on a text. &nbsp;Neither can folks talk over one another as they could
if, say, everyone was mic-ed electronically. &nbsp;The HM can only repeat
one thing at a time. &nbsp;So there is a built in technological
imperative of waiting one's turn.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>HM as a practice seems to function to &quot;decenter&quot; conversation in
large groups. &nbsp;You don't have to be on the stage, at the mic, or in
front to be a part of the conversation of the whole. &nbsp;And even in
the most inclusive groups, the process of coming up to the front
will be disproportionate intimidating to some and, &nbsp;in the case of
some disabilities, physically difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HMs on the face of it seems to address the classic problem that people
aren't really listening if they're working out what they're going to say
next by keeping the audience tasked on repeating the current
message.&nbsp;While someone with an electronic mic is addressing a passive
(and non-tasked) audience, they might disengage and begin
side-conversations if they find the speaker uninteresting, or challenge
the speaker for control of the sound-space by shouting or booing.&nbsp;A
tasked crowd is less able to do these things[1. Another possible factor
is that HMs are imperfect methods of&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;and so can't tolerate
as much other noise, and so people are obliged to be quieter to let it
work at all].&nbsp;This raises a question: as the form of the human mic
requires people to take part in other people's words, what do people do
when they disagree with the message?&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef01539361fc5a970b">Dan
Kervick</a>
gives a possible answer:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;At least at the GA I attended, it seemed to be understood that
you&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;try to repeat even those words you disagreed with.
People were repeating words even as they were giving down twinkles
of disapproval. However, even while repeating the words, you might
not say them with much enthusiasm. Sometimes people would repeat the
words fully, but in a &quot;yada, yada, yada ...&quot; tone of voice. The
force and enthusiasm element of the repeated words seems itself to
be part of the consensus-building aspect of the assembly discourse.
The speaker's rhetorical direction is influenced in some directions
and away from others by the audible and continuous rising and
falling of the assembly's support, and by the twinkles. [...] one
guy got very vulgar and self-indulgent, and the repetition flagged
in energy and took on a tone of &quot;C'mon man, stop being an ass.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This might not be universal but in this case rather than cancelling or
drowning out the original speaker, people who are part of the microphone
instead <em>modulated</em>&nbsp;the original voice to express their opinion- the
message and dissent to the message become one and the same thing. This
means it isn't content-neutral as a medium, but also that people calling
it &quot;the people's mic&quot; aren't being entirely silly, as there's an extent
to which the crowd can imbue&nbsp;a statement with their own feelings about
that statement (although it clearly can't apply past the people taking
part).</p>
<p>In addition to the decentering point made
above&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef0154373e0ae7970c">some</a>in
the comments at APPS make the point that this is a form of amplification
that's slower and so friendlier to those who might not otherwise want to
step up and speak, but at Occupy Patriarchy Lucinda Marshall argues that
the human mic <a class="reference external" href="http://occupypatriarchy.org/2011/11/16/empowering-the-feminist-voice-at-occupy-confronting-the-silencing-of-mic-check-and-other-misogynies-in-the-occupy-movement/">isn't&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;that
empowering</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Listening&nbsp;to people yell, “Mic Check!” at Occupy locations
throughout the country, it is hard not to observe that those with
the loudest voices are the ones who really get heard with this
system, and those voices usually are male baritones.&nbsp; Talking to
women here in Washington and also reading reports from elsewhere, it
is clear that many women find this system of having to yell at the
top of your lungs to be one that is an uncomfortable way to
communicate and participate.&nbsp; Some women report being harassed when
they speak, and even of mics being grabbed from them.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;universal&nbsp;experience but it's a problem that
should qualify descriptions of HM's democratic virtue - &nbsp;for all its
merits it is as heart a means of amplification and that leaves it
vulnerable&nbsp;to existing disparities in voice.&nbsp;Still, it's a method that
has potential to enhance the deliberativeness of public conversation and
open up and democratize (to some extent) the sound-space, and so is far
more than the simple yelling it might appear to be at first.</p>
<p>Given this understanding of what the HMs are supposed to do, it becomes
clear that some groups aren't really using them correctly. Case in
point, &nbsp;a&nbsp;group of protesters at Cambridge University used what they
claimed was a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.defendeducation.co.uk/go-home-david-an-epistle-to-david-willetts">people's
mic</a>&quot;
to <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2011/11/22/selfish-and-deluded/#comments">shut-down a David Willetts
event</a>,
but if it was it's a much poorer conception of the mic than the one
emerging as their aim wasn't to conduct discussion but to close it down,
not opening up the sound-space but filling with white noise to make it
unusable.&nbsp;As the form of the human mic becomes better established it'll
be interesting to see if it keeps its original deliberative spirit.</p>

					<p>“It's like when we used to let kings take over from their fathers:
that's the craziest rule that ever existed. If the king dies they let
his kid be the king - what are the odds that he's not going to be a
piece of shit? That's one of the weirdest things that we've ever done as
a race of people.” &nbsp;- Louis C.K.</p>
<p>I’ll confess I wasn’t that excited when it was announced they’re finally
getting round to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544">ending male primogeniture for the
monarchy</a>. While it’s good in
principle in the sense that it’s absurd and sexist to say that a
second-born son is going to be a better ruler than a first-born
daughter, it’s also a bit absurd to say the first-born is inherently
going to be better at the job than the second-born. After a bit more
thought though, I realised that if you look at it from the other
direction (who it keeps off the throne) it actually makes a lot of sense
as a method of reducing violent&nbsp;political&nbsp;conflict.</p>
<p>If we imagine a different situation where an out-going king chose one of
their children on the basis of temperament and competency, this would
for many years introduce uncertainty about who the next king would be.
Uncertainty raises the potential power of factions as they angle behind
various contenders which in turn increases the probability of violence.
By introducing criteria for a ‘good king’ it would also make it more
likely that outsiders would try to make a case that they
better&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;the criteria than any of the heirs on offer, which again,
increases the likelihood of violence. Always sticking with the
first-born means you don't have to judge on any other criteria, and the
order of&nbsp;succession&nbsp;will change as few times as possible[1. To bring
this back to male primogeniture, because swapping heirs from a girl to a
boy increases the number of order changes, on the face of it it's a bad
thing - but if the fundamental concern is stability and there's a
substantial faction that would back a male heir over a female heir
anyway, there's nothing to be gained by a system
that&nbsp;legitimized&nbsp;another potential faction.].&nbsp;So looking at it this way
it isn’t about selecting the right ruler, it’s about establishing norms
that disqualify everyone else. Lots of people can raise an army but
almost no one is the first-born son of the king.</p>
<p>All this was going through my head about about the same time as I was
reading the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books, which was convenient because
Martin spends an a lot of time dwelling on the problems of succession.
While the series is often quite <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/18/realpolitik_in_a_fantasy_world">politically
interesting</a>&nbsp;what
I hadn’t noticed straight-off is how methodical he is at taking apart
and examining the problem of what makes a monarch legitimate - each of
the various Kings that end up fighting over the Iron Throne in <em>Game of
Thrones</em> and <em>Clash of Kings</em> are operating on different principles of
legitimation. Because Robert and Ned have overthrown Aeron the norms
governing succession have broken down and the stage is set for people
who would ordinarily be disqualified to make a play for the throne.
Given Joffrey is illegitimate, Stannis’ claim as the younger brother of
ex-King Robert is fairly straight-forward but there is no way for Renly
to trace a claim that doesn’t involve going through Stannis first.
Instead Renly bases his claim on a charismatic populism, not that he is
the rightful heir but that he would be a better and more popular king
than everyone else is on offer. Elsewhere Robb Stark is effectively
making the case for a right of national self-determination for the
North, Joffrey’s claim is mostly already being on the throne (there’s a
lot to be said for institutional inertia) and when the Greyjoys start
making trouble, they claim their lands by right of conquest - something
that lurks in the background of everyone else’s claims is their ability
to enforce them (the throne they’re competing over is literally made of
swords after all).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all of these are incompatible (there’s no
particular reason why Renly’s populism needs to clash with Robb’s
national self-determination) but between them all they lack a common
denominator to settle the issue other than endless bloody war, that’s
exactly what happened. While saying primogeniture results in peace would
clearly be an overstatement, it definitely has its upside. It’s also
inherently unstable because of the original problem that, just as it
doesn’t have a mechanism for selecting the most fit king, it also
doesn’t have a method of weeding out unfit ones either - for each
generation debilitating mental illness is a roll of the dice, as is the
possibility that the new monarch might just be such an awful person that
they threaten the system. It’s not wonderful, but part of what makes
Westeros such a depressing place is that sometimes it might just be as
good as you're going to get.</p>

<p>This is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-plan-to-take-charge-of-scottish-independence-vote-6260514.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.</p>
<p>Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &quot;independence lite&quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.</p>
<p>There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Kellner of YouGov has a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">good run
down</a>
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html">they're leaving a space open for it to
return</a>,
and ERS Scotland<a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases">is advocating a different
form</a> of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.</p>
<p>One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;independence?</p>
<p>One answer would be that the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.</p>
<p>There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&nbsp;information&nbsp;on if people would
prefer&nbsp;independence&nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.</p>
<p>If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Would you like a change to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Would you prefer&nbsp;independence or devo-max?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.</p>
<p>“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.</p>
<p>From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&nbsp;political&nbsp;stitch-up in&nbsp;Westminster).&nbsp;This leaves either&nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Johannhari-150x150.jpg" />The Independent has finished it's investigation into the
Johann Hari saga and while&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html">Hari has
apologised</a>,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:</p>
<blockquote>
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.<strong>(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university</strong>.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&nbsp;seems to suggest that &quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&nbsp;acquainted - as <a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html">Jeremy Duns
points
out</a>,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.</p>

kids</a>
is obviously walking a mine field of every variety, but looking at the
site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.</blockquote>
<p>Which might be taking small liberties with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html">original
intent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.</blockquote>
<p>Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&quot; Bell said. &quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview
with Bell himself.</p>

<div><p><strong>|image0|****Assorted 'Let’s Kill Hitler' thoughts:****</strong></p>
</div><div><ul class="simple">
<li>The one thing you can say about Moffat stories is that they are
bursting with ideas, sometimes they don’t mesh well (a problem I have
with the Library two-parter) but when it works the show is just alive
with creative energy. This week we had: many, many details of River
Song’s increasingly temporally confused backstory - the crew of the
Enterprise manning the T-1000 with polite and deadly robot jellyfish,
travelling through time, setting right what once went wrong with
horrible horrible torture - &nbsp;a mysterious religious order devoted to
answering the final question and ending the universe - &nbsp;extractor
fans! This had it all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.abyssandapex.com/200710-wikihistory.html">Everyone kills Hitler on their first
trip</a>.</li>
<li>Clearly the crew of the Justice Vehicle are pretty awful people. Most
stories about time travellers who try to kill Hitler give them a
motive of trying to prevent the wrongs of the past (and then learn
important lessons about knock-on effects), the ‘travel to the very
last moment of their life and torture them’ approach is more
respectful of the timeline but also more morally reprehensible. It
has no deterrent effect, in fact it’s vital no one knows about them
because telling people about it would effect the timeline - what it
comes down to is people in the far future judging your life according
to criteria you’re not aware of and punishing you in a way that’s
really only to the benefit of their bloodlust. Hitler I imagine we
can all agree belongs on the shit list, but if Churchill (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html">not
universally a wonderful
person</a>)
had a visitor to his deathbed people might be more split.</li>
<li>Time travellers creating an afterlife because God let us down by not
existing is also dipped into briefly in the Baxter and Clarke novel
‘<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days">The Light of Other
Days</a>’,
where towards the end the perfection of time-traversing wormholes
allows the far future to download and recreate the brain at the
moment of death. Sufficiently advanced technology indeed.</li>
<li>Questions that cause the universe to end have a good pedigree. While
the obvious association of an ultimate question given Adams’ Who
connection is to Hitchhikers, what this made me think more of more
are two classic short stories, Clarke’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html">The Nine Billion Names of
God</a>’
and Asimov’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last
Question</a>’. In ‘The
Nine Billion’ a computer is built to systematically list all the
possible names of God in the belief that when this happens the
purpose of the universe will be fulfilled and it will promptly shut
up shop - the final question is answered and silence will fall
(coincidentally, the stars going out now qualifies as a recurring
thing in New Who). In ‘The Last Question’ successive generations from
the near-present to the heat-death ask a question of the increasingly
sophisticated machines they’ve created, a question that’s at first an
intellectual curiosity and then gradually the last and only relevant
question: “Can entropy be reversed?”. While interesting I don’t think
this is any use for plot guessing purposes, I’m just hoping for
something better than “Doctor Who?” (Although there would be
something very Adamish in an inter-temporal war and attempted
universe-cide resulting from a very badly misunderstood knock knock
joke.)</li>
<li>As Mels grows up alongside with her parents, Moffat seems to be
pushing the idea that effectively they did raise her anyway and so
this solves the problem of how the show can tonally have Amy and Rory
having adventures not related to getting their stolen child back. I’m
willing to accept this-ish,but clearly Rory and Amy would be better
parents to a child now then they would have been when they themselves
were children. Given Mels seems to have a slightly rocky life and
most of what they know about River’s later life is that she’s
imprisoned in the Stormcage (which really in terms of actually
keeping people in is almost as bad as Arkham), it’d be easy for them
to imagine that Melody would have had a much better life if they’d
properly had the chance to raise her. It's a bit of a serious downer
and I’m curious to see if the show has any further interest in
addressing it.</li>
<li>Is the Doctor just dressing to go out in style, or does the outfit
change signify like in ‘Flesh and Stone’ that there’s a bit of story
missing that might appear later on? As ever, there is insufficient
data for a meaningful answer.</li>
