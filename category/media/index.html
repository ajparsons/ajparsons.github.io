					<p>Yesterday's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism
Project</a>&nbsp;column introduced the
internet to what is highly likely to be a new urban legend: Slut
dropping. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">The full story
goes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
He described a group of excited male first-years who told him about
a new trend: “slut dropping”. The process, they explained, involves
driving around town with friends in the early hours of the morning
and offering a lift home to a young woman they deem a “slut”
(usually a woman in a “post-club state”). After asking her address,
they drive as fast and as far as possible in the opposite direction
before forcing the woman out of the car and using a camera to film
her “standing by the side of the road as they drive away”.&nbsp; Some of
the images find their way onto the internet, part of a disturbing
new trend of ‘slut-shaming’. On one occasion, the first-year added,
it had taken the girl eight hours to get home. When asked how he
knew, he explained that they were ‘friends’ on Facebook.</blockquote>
<p>There are obvious reasons to be suspicious of this: it's incredibly
elaborate and our source is 'people who our source talked to who heard
it off someone on facebook'. All urban legends seem to happen at that
friend of friend remove, both&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;and distant. Another interesting
aspect is &nbsp;'offering a lift home' because the story now involves the
woman making a choice. Urban legends are the oldest form of education -
telling you what choices and decisions are good or bad. This&nbsp;is why
urban legends are often structured exactly like horror stories, with
shared origins in scary stories told to teach the young lessons. &nbsp;It's
not enough that horrible things happen to you, you have to have made
choices that lead to this - as Cabin in the Woods put it&nbsp;&quot;if they don’t
transgress, they can’t be punished”.</p>
<p>Brunvard argues that urban legends &quot;often&nbsp;depict&nbsp;a clash between modern
conditions and some aspect of a traditional life-style&quot;[1. Brunvard, Jan
Harold (1981), The Vanishing Hitchhiker, New York: Norton, p. 18&nbsp;] and
here the conflict is with the idea of the modern, sexually liberated
woman. In this case the woman has committed three sins, looking like a
&quot;slut&quot;, walking home alone in the early hours and accepting a lift in a
stranger's car.&nbsp;That an urban legend obeys the rule of three isn't a
huge surprise - it's a storytelling rule for a reason, and urban legends
like all good memes will mutate till they find their most
attractive-to-spread form. We're invited to feel disgust that there are
people out there who would do this, which&nbsp;fascinatingly&nbsp;is the emotion
the most successful urban legends will pull on.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Heath_Emotional_Selection.pdf">Heath, Bell and
Sternberg
argue</a>&nbsp;(p
32)&nbsp;that urban legends aren't just selected on&nbsp;informational &nbsp;content,
but emotional content and will mutate to their most disgusting form:</p>
<blockquote>
In general, the studies provide converging evidence for emotional
selection. Study 1 showed that, controlling for informational
aspects of truth and usefulness, people were more willing to pass
along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 manipulated
levels of disgust, and showed that people preferred to pass along
the versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3
showed that legends could be reliably coded for individual story
motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated
substance). It also showed that the number of motifs affected
popularity; legends that contained more disgust motifs were more
likely to be passed along and were distributed more widely on web
sites that specialize in contemporary legends. The results of Study
3 are particularly interesting because they suggest that emotional
selection may alter the distribution of memes in the social
environment.</blockquote>
<p>There are clues as to what earlier versions of this legend may have
looked like: they don't just drop women off in the middle of nowhere -
they take pictures, they put it on&nbsp;Facebook! And what happens next? The
story spreads - look at the words used to describe 'slut dropping' in
follow-ups:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/09/slut-dropping-becomes-dis_n_1952553.html">Huffington Post
headline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;'Slut Dropping' Becomes Disturbing Trend In England&quot;</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://jezebel.com/5950287/slut+dropping-and-other-ways-college-teaches-kids-to-be-sexist-assholes">Jezebel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Today, let me introduce you to a practice known as &quot;slut-dropping.&quot;
Apparently it's all the rage in the UK, and I'm shocked that it
hasn't caught on Stateside, since this sounds right up a lot of
jerks' alleys.</blockquote>
<p>Here the meme has mutated again - it's not just a single
horrible&nbsp;incident, it's a trend, it has a <em>name</em>, it's happening
everywhere! We're no longer at the mercy of a depraved few, but exist in
a depraved society where this happens all the time. I don't know about
you, but that sounds pretty disgusting and spreadable.</p>
<p>Throughout this post I've been pretty dismissive of the idea that this
is a real thing because it has so many traits of an urban legend that
it'd be a surprise if it wasn't - there is of course
the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;that this happened somewhere at least once and mutated
into the legend it has now become. However as described 'slut dropping'
pretty much amounts to abduction and police records in the area in
question (where is that again?) could be a help for those looking to
confirm the story (though of course lack of records doesn't necessarily
disprove it) - it'll be interesting to see if anyone comes up with
anything.</p>
<p>As urban legends are always mutating to get around your defences and
spread themselves it's hard to blame anyone too much for giving this one
a kickstart but as&nbsp;Bates put that story quite early on, that's where a
lot of the attention is while the general point and the other examples
given are really worthy of a bit more attention. Go read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">the rest of
that
article</a>
again, we don't need&nbsp;mythical&nbsp;cars dropping women off in the middle of
nowhere for a lot to be wrong here.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Johannhari-150x150.jpg" />The Independent has finished it's investigation into the
Johann Hari saga and while&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html">Hari has
apologised</a>,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:</p>
<blockquote>
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.<strong>(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university</strong>.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&nbsp;seems to suggest that &quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&nbsp;acquainted - as <a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html">Jeremy Duns
points
out</a>,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx"><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/binladen-300x247.png" /></a>A colouring book setting out to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx">explain 9/11 to
kids</a>
is obviously walking a mine field of every variety, but looking at the
site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.</blockquote>
<p>Which might be taking small liberties with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html">original
intent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after

you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.</blockquote>
<p>Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&quot; Bell said. &quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview
with Bell himself.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidmichaelshanks/2449510845/"><img alt="Half Mast" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2449510845_85e1c422f3.jpg" /></a>It's inevitable with breaking stories that the media is
going to call some things wrong, what's more concerning is that it tends
to do this in ways that are revealing of deeper problems. Immediately
after the attacks in Norway the commentariat's initial reaction was to
blame it on Islamic terrorism, which is understandable because it is
after all the sexiest kind of terrorism. That the information that the
majority of terrorist attacks in Europe are <a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/25/missing_the_real_warning_signs">committed by home grown
groups</a>
is easily found on the internet is neither here nor there - as Charlie
Brooker <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/24/charlie-brooker-norway-mass-killings">put
it</a>,
the media coverage was less experts than guessers and they &quot;were
terrible, like toddlers hypothesising how a helicopter works.&quot;</p>
<p>The news media is rarely humbled or apologetic when they get things
wrong but simply moves on to being wrong about something else, often in
the same story. The next step here is the assertion with little proof,
that Anders Breivik is insane. It might well turn out that he is, but in
the meantime not only does this reinforce the harmful stereotype
connecting mental health issues with violence, it's also a bit
convenient because irrational people can't be expected to be reacting to
incentives and so it absolves anyone else of responsibility in creating
an environment where he felt that terrorism was a good idea. It's not
clear to me that his actions are inherently irrational, it's very
apparently a politically motivated crime with the express purpose of a)
harming 'the enemy' and b) gaining him and his beliefs exposure. Given
the well-established pattern of how the world's media cover shootings, b
was at least was a slam dunk. The Norwegian court in closing the hearing
was operating under the strange principle that it shouldn't be a
complacent part of a mass murderer's pre-meditated promotion strategy,
something that media outlets have always had much more trouble doing.
His (I'm assuming pre-prepared) image plastered websites and newspapers
for days, the 24 news channels didn't stop for speculation and
examination of his motives, and the attack spurred a series of '<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">He's
obviously an awful person, but he's not
wrong</a>'
articles. It's not the start of the revolution he hoped for but as a
political act, it was far from inconsequential. Dismissing him as simply
a 'maniac' ignores the fact that the reaction of the media to massacres
like these actually acts as a powerful incentive to commit them.</p>
<p>On the other side of the blame game, insanity neatly helps those who
occupy relatively mainstream spaces in society and have spent years fear
mongering about Islam pending takeover of Europe to create a comfortable
distance between themselves and Breivik. I'm going to pick on Tim
Stanley's <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100098575/whatever-liberal-commentators-say-the-tea-party-does-not-bear-responsibility-for-anders-breivik/">Telegraph
post</a>
for being well ahead of the curve on this one. Despite Breivik obvious
political motivations (like, he wrote them down) Stanley insists that
these are the actions of a 'lone psychopath', and that any connection
between his actions and his claimed motivations are entirely
coincidental. His statement that &quot;[t]he kind of person who can
systematically shoot and kill that many people is mentally ill or
possessed by demons&quot; is helpful, because here 'mental illness' is
performing exactly the same role that blaming things on demons does, a
scapegoat that absolves us of responsibility[1. Stanley's attempt to
dismiss his strawman notion that 'the left' thinks 'the right' is
responsible for all anti-Islamic violence by equating it with the
absurdity of the idea that 'the left' must be responsible for all
anti-Christian violence is especially cruel given that many Christians
would consider themselves to be on the left, and just the other year
churchgoers in Tennessee were gunned down by a man with a hatred of
liberals <a class="reference external" href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/knoxville-church-shooters-manifesto">who
name-checked</a>
several of the same people as Breivik. Also despite what he says links
between Tea&nbsp;Party groups and white supremacists are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/pages/tea-party-report">alive and
credible</a>.]. Somehow
these 'lone wolves' get the idea that the world would be a better place
without certain groups and while maybe they're just picking ideas out of
the aether, it is at least slightly possible that they are aided to
these positions by reading the rhetoric of the people they say they're
reading. While with the media platform issue there are at least clear
steps that could be taken to reduce the problem, I'm not exactly sure
what the solution is here. I do think there's some sort of moral duty
incumbent on people not to make their careers spreading xenophobia and
hate, but that's less because people might go out and shoot people and
more because it's a generally shit thing to do. Melanie Phillips'
response to finding two of her articles within his manifesto <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/25/norway-melanie-phillips-hits-back">is
revealing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The supposed beliefs of Norway massacre's perpetrator has got the
left in general wetting itself in delirium at this apparently
heaven-sent opportunity to take down those who fight for life,
liberty and western civilisation against those who would destroy
it.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I have vague sympathy here because Philips isn't actively fermenting
armed revolution but to me safeguarding western civilisation is a cause
that's probably worth killing for. If you're telling people the stakes
are <em>that</em> high, <a class="reference external" href="http://flyingrodent.blogspot.com/2011/07/worlds-first-anti-jihadist-mass.html">can you really claim distance when people take you
seriously</a>?
If having been repeatedly told by authority figures that your cause is
literally the defence of western civilisation, you find yourself unable
to effect the mainstream political process but know that you'll be given
a world-wide platform if you commit a horrific act, why wouldn't it be
rational to put your manifesto on the internet and go kill a bunch of
kids? If the idea of 'killing innocents so more can be saved' is
inherently crazy then there's a lot of foreign policy we need to
revisit, and if killing full stop is a sign of deranged mind it's in
even bigger trouble.</p>
<p>My point here is that you don't have to be crazy to be an extremist and
you don't have to be crazy to kill people, either might be immoral but
by themselves do not suggest anything about someone's sanity. It might
yet turn out that Breivik is insane (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-is-insane-says-his-lawyer-2326232.html">his lawyer thinks he
is</a>,
let's wait for the doctors) but should that happen it doesn't
retrospectively improve the current rhetoric any more than if the attack
had been carried out by al-Qaeda it would have made the initial coverage
any less terrible - it simply means that that particular guess was
correct and it's one rooted in prejudices and self-interest rather than
reality.</p>
