					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Sergebac7thcentury-150x150.jpg" />The Church of England's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1475149/s-s%20marriage.pdf">response</a>&nbsp;to
the consultation&nbsp;on same-sex marriage caused some waves this week.&nbsp;Given
the debates inside the church on homosexuality that the response isn't a
heartful endorsement isn't a huge surprise, but it's always a little bit
disappointing to be reminded that an organisation still so entwined with
the state holds these views.</p>
<p>It's well worth a read though, even if you find their arguments
unconvincing it's filled with interesting facts - did you know that you
have a right to be wed in your parish church and the vicar has to
perform it, regardless of your religious affiliation (or lack thereof)?
'The church will be forced to marry people!' has been out of the bag for
a while apparently.</p>
<p>I found a few sections in particular worth pulling out.&nbsp;The response
opens claiming that that the church has actually been pretty progressive
on same-sex couples in general but marriage is something that needs
special consideration:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;We have supported various legal changes in recent years to remove
unjustified discrimination and create greater legal rights for same
sex couples and we welcome that fact that previous legal and
material inequities between heterosexual and same-sex partnerships
have now been satisfactorily addressed.</blockquote>
<p>As has been pointed out a few times, this is a pretty generous
interpretion of the Church's history on the matter. Their contribution
to the Civil Partnership Bill in 2004 was notable for six bishops trying
to help <a class="reference external" href="http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/history-written-and-rewritten/">sink
it</a>
with a wrecking&nbsp;amendment, it's&nbsp;only fourteen years since the highest
figures in the church argued that gay people between 16 and 18 having
sex should <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/116865.stm">remain
criminalized</a>&nbsp;because
dropping the age of consent would send a 'wrong message', and in 2006
they <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6293115.stm">boldly stood up</a> for
the rights of the Catholic Church to have more opt-outs allowing
discrimination against same-sex couples.&nbsp;The Anglican community is
hardly <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2012/jun/12/church-of-england-gay-marriage">all on the same side on
this</a>,
but the direction the church has chosen to use its power is a little
revealing.</p>
<p>Next up is the claim that that marriage as currently stands is a
timeless institution that's existed pretty much forever - trying to put
it that arguing&nbsp;against one-man-one-woman marriage is like arguing
against gravity - it's just a fact, that's what&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In common with almost all other Churches, the Church of England
holds, as a matter of doctrine and derived from the teaching of
Christ himself, that marriage in general – and not just the marriage
of Christians – is, in its nature, a lifelong union of <strong>one man
with one woman</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Such a move would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the
union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>throughout history</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Throughout <strong>history</strong>, in the laws of the land and in the Church of
England‘s Book of Common Prayer on which the laws concerning
marriage are grounded, marriage has been <strong>understood to be, always
and exclusively, between a woman and a man.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The intrinsic nature of marriage, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>since before the advent of either church or state</strong>, is the union
of a man and a woman.</p>
<p>Marriage affords many benefits to society, which include
<strong>mutuality</strong>, fidelity and &nbsp;biological complementarity with the
possibility of procreation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another case where there's quite a substantial clash with
reality. Quite a few cultures have accepted definitions of marriage
outside of this, same-sex&nbsp;marriage has existed in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions">various forms at
various
times</a>, and
polygamous&nbsp;cultures are&nbsp;hardly rare - awkwardly several of them
documented this fact in their holy books and as a result there are
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_bibl0.htm">eight kinds of
marriage</a> sanctioned
in the Bible. While none of them are same sex as such, many differ from
the &quot;lifelong union of&nbsp;one man with one woman&quot; as has existed &quot;before
the advent of either church or state&quot;.</p>
<p>Mentioning 'mutuality' is an interesting point, because that's one
aspect of marriage that even within the Church's (relatively short)
history hasn't been constant. &nbsp;On page 2 they cite a definition
of&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts.aspx">Common
Worship</a>&nbsp;which
draws heavily on the marriage vows:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The Church of Christ understands marriage to be, in the will of
God, the union of a man and a woman, for better, for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,&nbsp;to love and to
cherish, till parted by death.&quot; (Common Worship: Pastoral Services,
page 177)</blockquote>
<p>But if we go back to<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-of-solemnization-of-matrimony.aspx">the Book of Common
Prayer</a>&nbsp;cited
above&nbsp;we quickly find a departure from this&nbsp;mutuality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long
as ye both shall live?</p>
<p>The Man shall answer,</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Then shall the Priest say unto the Woman,</p>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
<strong>obey him, and serve him</strong>, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness
and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so
long as ye both shall live?</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Woman shall answer,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I will.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/marriage.aspx">revised Common
Worship</a>
this has been ironed out and 'obey' banished to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/alternativetexts.aspx#vows">alternative
vows</a>&nbsp;(where
'serve' is nowhere to be found not technically being part of the vows in
the original). Now this shift isn't that&nbsp;obscure&nbsp;or hidden knowledge,
but that the mutual character of marriage is a somewhat modern
institution is something that the church should remember. They haven't
been protecting a perfectly Christian conception of marriage while the
rest of society muddled and changed it's definitions - they've been
right here with us as marriage evolved into what it is today.</p>
<p>This next one is my favourite:</p>
<blockquote>
To argue that this is of no social value is to assert that men and
women are simply interchangeable individuals. It also undermines
many of the arguments which <strong>support the deeper involvement of
women in all social institutions</strong> on the grounds that a society
cannot flourish without the specific and distinctive contributions
of each gender.</blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful argument that same-sex marriage undermines arguments
against sexism. After all, if we need women in every boardroom don't we
need them in every&nbsp;marriage?&nbsp;This is of course all the less convincing
coming from an organisation that is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18157584">at this very
moment</a> fudging the entry of
women into its corridors of power.</p>
<p>To round it off the annex plays some interesting games with definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only kind of marriage which English law recognises is one which
is&nbsp;essentially <strong>the voluntary union for life of one man with one
woman to the exclusion of all others.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>That institution would be one which was defined <strong>as the voluntary
union for life of any two persons</strong>. English law would, as a result,
cease to provide or recognise an institution that represented the
traditional understanding of marriage as the voluntary union for
life of one man with one woman</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the established institution of marriage, as currently defined and
recognised in English law, would in effect, have been abolished and
replaced <strong>by a new statutory concept which the Church – and many
outside the Church – would struggle to recognise as amounting to
marriage at all. A man and a woman who wished to enter into the
traditional institution of marriage would no longer have the
opportunity to do so.</strong> Only the new, statutory institution, which
defined a &nbsp;marriage‘ as the voluntary union of any two persons,
would be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, in the past marriage was between 'a man and a woman' now it'll
be between 'two persons' - this will totally ruin it for all those
couples that are made up of a man and woman but contain no persons!</p>
<p>It's hard to pin down why but I find this is one of the most
distasteful&nbsp;arguments in the whole thing. &nbsp;What they're implying here is
that there's&nbsp;harm in some way being done to heterosexual married couples
-&nbsp;that the marriage they had no longer existed, its gone, erased with a
pen-stroke, replaced by a ghoul that wears its face but isn't the same
at all. It crosses the line from inventing history to inventing harm,
and there's something ugly in that.</p>
