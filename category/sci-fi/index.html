					<p><em>(Spoilers for Black Mirror, &nbsp;11/22/63&nbsp;- minor spoilers for
Caprica,&nbsp;Buffy, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf - but you know, read it anyway.)</em></p>
<p>At what point does it become wrong to want to change the way things are?</p>
<p>While it is natural to want this at the heart of so many stories is the
idea that at some point trying to change the universe becomes unhealthy
and&nbsp;monstrous. Anxiety in this mould about technological progress has
been a feature of science fiction since the beginning - but anxiety
about technological progress&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;really about technology, what
‘science is bad’ is really saying is that people are bad and that the
ability science gives us to control our own destiny will distort and
twist us in the most fundamental ways.</p>
<p>Black Mirror definitely buys into this relationship between the bad
people and their toys. <em>The National Anthem</em> argues that modern
technology is bringing us closer to animals rather than lifting us above
(although I’m not convinced the story <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/12/black-mirror-the-media-and-the-mob/">pulled off the mob aspect that
well</a>),
<em>The Entire History of You</em> and <em>Be Right Back</em> share a theme that the
imperfection of memory is a blessing that keeps us from living in the
past and technology that allows us to re-experience things we’ve lost
keeps us from growing as people.</p>
<p><em>Be Right Back</em>&nbsp;deals with Martha, who after the death of her husband
(Ash) is signed up to a internet start-up that given access to the
social media profiles of the dead can recreate their personality, given
voice samples can call you on the phone, and given photos (plus money)
can send you a robot to take their place. This shares a lot of DNA with
the Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica, where a major set of plot
threats are various character’s ambitions for protagonist Zoe’s (who
‘dies’ in the first episode) resurrection&nbsp;computer program. Like <em>Be
Right Back</em>, Caprica’s method of resurrection is based on the equivalent
of scouring social networks and the internet but in Caprica’s case this
is actually good enough and the end results are effectively perfect
copies of the original people.</p>
<p>In <em>Be Right Back</em> Robot Ash’s presence is harmful because he
simply&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;a good enough copy to replace the original, what was meant
to displace grief ends up extending it. Caprica looks more towards the
social fallout of the possible end of death. From Clarice’s plans to
create a heaven for martyrs of her religion to Daniel’s plans to sell
the technology and make it available widely (complete with promo video
of a man stepping out from behind his coffin to his grieving family)
there is no doubt that the technology works, simply how it is going to
be used. Robot Ash is flawed because the story model requires a fatal
flaw (like these <a class="reference external" href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/">great tales of caveman science
fiction</a>).
Using technology (or magic) to address your desires (resulting from
ambition, grief) will only create monsters - either figurative or
literal.</p>
<p>Something that’s fun with these kind of stories is to think about how
the possible future society that’s got over these issues will look back
on them. If you could be resurrected from your social networks and it
could be perfect - would this be wrong? Would resurrection really be so
bad for us as a society? If the technology was perfect (say people made
regular backups) would a version of Ash who could only talk out of a
mobile phone be a completely different order than if the car accident
had just paralysed him? Isn’t it really another degree of the great
spectrum of disability? What I wonder is if this is the kind of attitude
that people in a few hundred years are going to find rather quaint -
will they be horrified at the&nbsp;frailness&nbsp;of all those people who went
through their lives without the wifi chip in their skull taking backups,
and a little amused that we thought their deathless society would be an
unnatural, wrong place?</p>
<p>The end of death is one of the keystones of the transhumanist future and
different approaches abound everywhere in science fiction. In
Bear’s&nbsp;<em>Eon</em>&nbsp;universe, the inhabitants of Axis City get two chances in
a physical body before an indefinite existence in city memory. In
Clarke’s<em>&nbsp;City and The Star</em>s in order to make immortality viable
over millions of years without society growing stale (which fails, but
anyway) the people of Diaspar use a form of reincarnation, where people
are given twenty years or so to establish new lives before their
previous memories are returned to them. In Red Dwarf dead crew can be
bought back to life as holograms and the dead are a growing force in
society, when Rimmer is whining about being dead Lister just argues that
“death isn’t the handicap it used to be in the olden days.
It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;screw your career up the way it used to”.</p>
<p>There is a similar approach to the sanctity of death in fantasy where,
despite the otherwise strangeness of the world, often reversing ‘natural
death’ remains an uncrossable line. Magical worlds that co-exist with
the real world tend to certain rules to explain why the real world is
only superficially altered from our own with the addition of these
fantastic elements, usually in some form of unwritten Prime Directive of
non-interference - the specific problem being that magical rules tend to
be fair (in the sense that all actions can be reversed - at a cost)
whereas the real world is notably for being distinctly unfair. Harry
Potter's world has a host of magical ailments for magical healers to fix
but St Mungo’s doesn’t go around curing muggles of cancer. In Buffy,
Joyce and Tara are explicitly unable to be resurrected through magical
means because of the non-magical nature of the deaths and season five’s
<em>Forever</em> dwells on the horrificness of trying to break this rule. While
the real- and other-world mix to some degree, real-world death is
repeatedly treated as a line the other just can't cross, or at least not
lightly.</p>
<p>In science fiction this comes up quite a lot in stories about time
travel - attempts to fix real-world wrongs using otherworldly
time-travel are frequently the source rather than remedy of regret.
As<em>&nbsp;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</em> puts it
&quot;within a science fictional space, memory and regret are, when taken
together, the set of necessary and sufficient elements required to
produce a time machine&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Whoverse this happens most explicitly
in <em>Father’s Day</em> when Rose's attempt to save her father literally
breaks the story-world apart and lets monsters in from beyond the fourth
wall to teach her a lesson. The Tenth Doctor's “Time Lord Victorious”
speech in <em>Waters of Mars</em> is effectively him declaring his refusal to
let his otherworldlyness bind his actions, hubris the story punishes him
for in short succession. However this is a line that Who is increasingly
fuzzy on, at the end of the <em>The Almost People</em> the Doctor gives Cleaves
what is in effect a magic potion to fix the brain clot in her brain.
Like Joyce’s aneurysm in Buffy, the clot isn't caused by the Doctor or
the events of the story, it's presented as a decidedly human problem
that's solved (in a moment) through magical means. Similarly, in last
year’s Christmas episode a normal man was flying back in a doomed plane
from a normal war and is rescued from death through essentially magical
means.</p>
<p>When a story is showing the dark side of Trying To Change How Things
Were it tends to show history breaking in two ways. In Red Dwarf’s
<em>Tikka to Ride</em> Kennedy’s assassination is accidentally prevented,
leading to an alternate history where Kennedy’s failings of a president
are given time to play out, leading to an earlier and different end to
the Cold War where the future the show is set in no longer exist, while
in Stephen King’s <em>11/22/63</em> time&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;want to be changed, and the
act of doing so on a large enough scale (preventing the Kennedy
assassination) breaks the universe, with earthquakes, disasters and a
decay of the laws of physics. One teaches the a lesson that history is
complicated and events have unexpected repercussions, the other that
meddling in the past is just Wrong with a capital W and you will be
punished for doing so.</p>
<p>At their core Black Mirror and the range of similar stories&nbsp;are
essentially conservative in the 'people aren't getting any better'
sense, but this also spills over into 'attempts to make people better
will always fail' - because the one thing we certainly can't be trusted
to change right is ourselves.&nbsp;A future where people play pick 'n' mix
with their memories, change history on a whim, and the dead walk on the
streets demanding equal rights is certainly weird and unsettling to us
today - but wouldn’t they find stories demanding a ‘dead’ person go away
so everyone else can move on a little bit horrifying themselves?</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/13147230-198x300.jpg:target:/uploads/13147230.jpg" />After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/terry-pratchett-sex-death-and-nature">this great
interview</a>
with Terry Pratchett&nbsp;I decided to go back and finish this post I was
writing about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth">*The Long
Earth*</a>, Pratchett's
recent collaboration with Stephen Baxter.&nbsp;Obviously, spoilers spoilers.</p>
<p>Basic setting summary: In <em>The Long Earth</em>, someone releases schematics
on the internet for an easy to build box with a switch. When the switch
is pressed, the user can travel either 'east' or 'west' through
infinite&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;Earths, with the near Earths being very similar to the
original 'datum' earth (but lacking in people) with weirder and wilder
creatures waiting in the far off Earths.&nbsp;One of the fun things about
reading collaborations between well-known authors is trying to break
down who introduced what elements.&nbsp;Sometimes you can pick up the voices,
but in cases like the Long Earth tracking the lineage of the ideas
involved is illuminating.&nbsp;While based on an old idea of Pratchett's, the
threads of it have appeared in a few previous Baxter books (which is
probably why the project is such a good fit.)</p>
<p>In Baxter's <em>Origin</em>, the world is changed by the&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of the Red
Moon (which replaces the boring grey one). The Red Moon travels
from&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;earth to parallel earth, opening up portals and picking up
and depositing creatures from world to world. Through this, it picked up
humanity's&nbsp;predecessors at various points in history and deposited them
on other earths, where they evolve in different and similar ways,
aquatic apes, puritans with tails, super-intelligent&nbsp;gorillas who hug
the surface of their gigantic and windswept Earth. So the idea that
there are places beside our own where humanity's cousins (in <em>The Long
Earth</em>'s case Trolls and Elves) developed in their own strange ways is
a&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>That Trolls are largely peaceful creatures who make people feel better
by singing while Elves are intelligent, malicious hunters where some
species farm others for their brains fits into the Pratchett&nbsp;rebellion
against Tolkien regarding elves (from <em>Lords and Ladies)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are terrific. They beget terror.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a
snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words
that have changed their meaning.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">No one ever said elves are nice.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are bad.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Long Earth</em> is also an example of, &nbsp;for lack of a better term,
&quot;Democratic Science Fiction&quot; - where an extraordinary change is put in
the hands of every person.&nbsp;What's a world like where everyone has
superpowers?&nbsp;&nbsp;When anyone can travel in time? When anyone can get a
potato and a switch, and step into another earth? This is ground Baxter
has visited before in a previous&nbsp;collaboration with Arthur C. Clark in
<em>The Light Of Other Days</em>, where the invention of wormhole technology
allows anyone to view any location, anywhere in history - effectively
abolishing privacy.</p>
<p>Lobsang is an interesting element, a sentient computer that claims to be
the reincarnated soul of a&nbsp;Tibetan&nbsp;car mechanic.&nbsp;Someone obscure
being&nbsp;reincarnated&nbsp;as a computer feels like a classic Pratchett&nbsp;footnote
joke (and there has been a 'Lobsang' in the Discworld-verse) , but it's
tempered and kept in line with a sci-fi universe by the heavy hinting
that Lobsang is just pretending to be reincarnated&nbsp;to have a better
claim to have personhood rights. To make an end of paragraph habit,
Baxter's collaboration with Clarke in the <em>Time Odyssey</em>&nbsp;series also
featured AI's with recognised rights.</p>
<p>You might guess from how often I've referred back to his previous books
that this story 'feels' more like Baxter than Pratchett but
his&nbsp;sensibilities&nbsp;are clearly there if you look. I wouldn't say it's
either of their greatest works, but it's a perfectly enjoyable read that
plays with its world in a way that I'm not sure would have come
naturally to either of them on their own.</p>
