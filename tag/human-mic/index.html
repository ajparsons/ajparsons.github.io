					<p>The idea of the 'human mic' was one born out of a practical necessity,
the police prevented the first OWS protests from
having&nbsp;electronic&nbsp;amplification so to compensate the mechanism of the HM
emerged, where the person currently with the 'mic' would say a short
phrase of their statement, which those around them would shout, before
the speaker moved onto the next phase and so on - there's a good example
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIK7uxBSAS0">here</a>:</p>
<p>In addition to solving the initial&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;problem Mark Lance and
Sydney Levy at the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html">New APPS
blog</a>&nbsp;point
out&nbsp;that this has some quite interesting effects on the nature of
discourse through the HMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is most interesting about the HM is the way that it shapes the
time and space of a discourse. &nbsp;Of course the most obvious feature
is that it slows things down. &nbsp;Everything is said twice. &nbsp;This is a
mixed blessing, no doubt, stretching out already long consensus
meetings. &nbsp;But at the same time, we must remember that we are
dealing with a huge, diverse crowd of people, many of whom are
completely new to the very idea of directly democratic
decision-making, and none of whom have much experience with this
group. &nbsp;So slowing things down and repeating everything that is said
before it is possible to respond also functions to draw people in
and lends an air of seriousness to the comments of others.</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice eliminates side-conversations. &nbsp;If you
participate in the HM, you have to listen so that you can repeat.
&nbsp;You can't be chatting snarkily with your neighbor, or even focusing
on a text. &nbsp;Neither can folks talk over one another as they could
if, say, everyone was mic-ed electronically. &nbsp;The HM can only repeat
one thing at a time. &nbsp;So there is a built in technological
imperative of waiting one's turn.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>HM as a practice seems to function to &quot;decenter&quot; conversation in
large groups. &nbsp;You don't have to be on the stage, at the mic, or in
front to be a part of the conversation of the whole. &nbsp;And even in
the most inclusive groups, the process of coming up to the front
will be disproportionate intimidating to some and, &nbsp;in the case of
some disabilities, physically difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HMs on the face of it seems to address the classic problem that people
aren't really listening if they're working out what they're going to say
next by keeping the audience tasked on repeating the current
message.&nbsp;While someone with an electronic mic is addressing a passive
(and non-tasked) audience, they might disengage and begin
side-conversations if they find the speaker uninteresting, or challenge
the speaker for control of the sound-space by shouting or booing.&nbsp;A
tasked crowd is less able to do these things[1. Another possible factor
is that HMs are imperfect methods of&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;and so can't tolerate
as much other noise, and so people are obliged to be quieter to let it
work at all].&nbsp;This raises a question: as the form of the human mic
requires people to take part in other people's words, what do people do
when they disagree with the message?&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef01539361fc5a970b">Dan
Kervick</a>
gives a possible answer:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;At least at the GA I attended, it seemed to be understood that
you&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;try to repeat even those words you disagreed with.
People were repeating words even as they were giving down twinkles
of disapproval. However, even while repeating the words, you might
not say them with much enthusiasm. Sometimes people would repeat the
words fully, but in a &quot;yada, yada, yada ...&quot; tone of voice. The
force and enthusiasm element of the repeated words seems itself to
be part of the consensus-building aspect of the assembly discourse.
The speaker's rhetorical direction is influenced in some directions
and away from others by the audible and continuous rising and
falling of the assembly's support, and by the twinkles. [...] one
guy got very vulgar and self-indulgent, and the repetition flagged
in energy and took on a tone of &quot;C'mon man, stop being an ass.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This might not be universal but in this case rather than cancelling or
drowning out the original speaker, people who are part of the microphone
instead <em>modulated</em>&nbsp;the original voice to express their opinion- the
message and dissent to the message become one and the same thing. This
means it isn't content-neutral as a medium, but also that people calling
it &quot;the people's mic&quot; aren't being entirely silly, as there's an extent
to which the crowd can imbue&nbsp;a statement with their own feelings about
that statement (although it clearly can't apply past the people taking
part).</p>
<p>In addition to the decentering point made
above&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef0154373e0ae7970c">some</a>in
the comments at APPS make the point that this is a form of amplification
that's slower and so friendlier to those who might not otherwise want to
step up and speak, but at Occupy Patriarchy Lucinda Marshall argues that
the human mic <a class="reference external" href="http://occupypatriarchy.org/2011/11/16/empowering-the-feminist-voice-at-occupy-confronting-the-silencing-of-mic-check-and-other-misogynies-in-the-occupy-movement/">isn't&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;that
empowering</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Listening&nbsp;to people yell, “Mic Check!” at Occupy locations
throughout the country, it is hard not to observe that those with
the loudest voices are the ones who really get heard with this
system, and those voices usually are male baritones.&nbsp; Talking to
women here in Washington and also reading reports from elsewhere, it
is clear that many women find this system of having to yell at the
top of your lungs to be one that is an uncomfortable way to
communicate and participate.&nbsp; Some women report being harassed when
they speak, and even of mics being grabbed from them.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;universal&nbsp;experience but it's a problem that
should qualify descriptions of HM's democratic virtue - &nbsp;for all its
merits it is as heart a means of amplification and that leaves it
vulnerable&nbsp;to existing disparities in voice.&nbsp;Still, it's a method that
has potential to enhance the deliberativeness of public conversation and
open up and democratize (to some extent) the sound-space, and so is far
more than the simple yelling it might appear to be at first.</p>
<p>Given this understanding of what the HMs are supposed to do, it becomes
clear that some groups aren't really using them correctly. Case in
point, &nbsp;a&nbsp;group of protesters at Cambridge University used what they
claimed was a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.defendeducation.co.uk/go-home-david-an-epistle-to-david-willetts">people's
mic</a>&quot;
to <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2011/11/22/selfish-and-deluded/#comments">shut-down a David Willetts
event</a>,
but if it was it's a much poorer conception of the mic than the one
emerging as their aim wasn't to conduct discussion but to close it down,
not opening up the sound-space but filling with white noise to make it
unusable.&nbsp;As the form of the human mic becomes better established it'll
be interesting to see if it keeps its original deliberative spirit.</p>
