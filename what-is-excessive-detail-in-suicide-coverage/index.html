					<p>This is an excerpt from a much longer piece on the history of suicide
and journalism. &nbsp;It contains description of suicide&nbsp;methods only in so
far as they are required to demonstrate the point being made.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Across a number of countries there are media guidelines on suicide
reporting (most voluntary, but New Zealand’s are governed by law). These
arrived in the UK in 2006 when the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)
added a new clause to the Editors’ Code of Practice, extending the
guidelines on reporting on topics likely to involve personal grief with
an explicit prohibition on publishing ‘excessive detail’ about suicide
methods. The article now reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt;5. Intrusion into grief or shock</p>
<p>&gt;i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and
approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication
handled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report
legal proceedings, such as inquests.</p>
<p>ii) When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive
detail about the method used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule has now been in effect for eight years and there have now been
sufficient cases to make determinations on what exactly this rule has
meant in practice. How have complaints turned out? What exactly is
‘excessive’ detail?</p>
<p>There have been forty-six complaints under this clause - most complaints
are brought by relatives of the deceased, with a small number being
triggered by suicide prevention organisations&nbsp;or elected officials. In
one case the PCC itself brought the complaint against
fourteen&nbsp;newspapers over the same story.</p>
<p>Many complaints are resolved with an apology or a voluntary redaction of
their online archive by the newspaper - but in some cases the PCCs
reasoning over what level of detail is or isn’t ‘excessive’ becomes
clearer. Examining all rulings involving 5.ii, I found that the PCC to
date have chosen to interpret it as a rule against popularizing or
explaining unusual or technical methods of suicide. Details tend to be
allowed when the method can in some sense be seen as ‘obvious’. To use
specific cases, it is wrong to tell people how many pills are a fatal
dose or how a suicide involving a balloon kit was accomplished but it is
acceptable to describe someone as having hung themselves with their
shoelaces.</p>
<p>In the case of hanging (a minority of PCC complaints but the most common
method of suicide in the UK), the PCC has repeated argued the material
used to perform the act does not constitute part of the method. In the
very first complaint under 5.ii it was argued
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==</a>] that the
inclusion of a “photograph taken from the centre’s CCTV footage of [a
man] walking towards a stairwell with a bed sheet tied around his neck”
was not excessive as the rule was ‘designed to prevent the inclusion of
detail in newspaper reports that might provoke ‘copycat’ suicides. The
inclusion of a photograph of the complainant’s father before his death
did not raise an issue under this part of the Code.’ Similarly, in 2011
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==</a>] a complaint
that about including the fact that someone had hung ‘himself with
shoelaces’ was included in the headline was rejected, arguing that “the
article had only referred to the material with which the complainant had
hanged himself. The Commission found that the reference under complaint
did not represent an excessive detail such that would represent a breach
of the Code.”.</p>
<p>The PCC also rejected a complaint in 2008 that inclusion of a picture of
a noose in a story about suicides in Bridgend was an excessive amount of
detail - “It had to have regard to the fact that – regrettably – there
had been a spate of deaths by hanging, and that this fact was
well-known. The picture of the noose did not make public anything new
about the deaths, or describe the actual process by which individuals
had used particular materials to take their own lives.”</p>
<p>This approach is a problem because contrary to the idea that everybody
already knows how to hang themselves, information about exact hanging
techniques varies and even minor details can change how attractive the
idea of hanging is to a person. Biddle et al. [1] conducted a study with
people who had attempted suicide explicitly aimed at finding out why
they did or didn’t choose hanging as a method. People who tried hanging
believed it would be quick, easy and could be done with materials to
hand. People who did not believed it would be slow, painful or that they
lacked the technical know-how or rope to make the noose. This last point
is especially important, for hanging object is method - this is
information that change the desirability of the method. The PCC fixation
on technical or pharmaceutical suicides misses the purpose of the rule -
the concealment of unnecessary elements that might change the likelihood
someone puts into practice a given method.</p>
<p>As shown earlier [in not published sections], method and suicidal intent
is highly interlinked - restricting methods (either through physical
restrictions or by creating ignorance) is the most effective way of
having an effect on suicide across a society. This is the area where the
scientific evidence is most certain and if journalists can be convinced
of this solitary point it would account for most of the effect any wider
restrictions would give. The PCC (or its successor body) needs to take
into scope ‘obvious’ suicide methods and descriptions that might make
them more salient in the mind of a reader. These are after all the most
common and so an area where efforts would be likely to have the most
impact.</p>
