					<p>I'm generally sceptical of approaches to the housing crisis that involve nice websites. I think prospects for techno-structural activism tend to be far more limited than nerds like me who build nice websites would like to believe.</p>
<p>But I like to keep an eye out. I'm not convinced by the rating sites that exist - there are too many properties and too few customers per property to be generally useful or gain the initial user base they need. Generating new data is hard. But can something be done with data that already exists?</p>
<p>Rent Square say they can use open data to calculate better rents and optimise the process - getting rents that both side can agree to quicker. Without seeing exactly what they're doing this might be a little unfair, but this seems a fiddly optimisation that's useful only in rare circumstances. </p>
<p>If you produce a number lower than the market rent for an area you have to convince the landlord they're not leaving money on the table - they have a good insight on how to do this. They argue that many landlords charge too much to pick up people immediately, but will get a tenant at that rate eventually (usually after more than a month fallow). So charge slightly less and you'll get someone quicker and actually get more rental income over several years (over 12 years the property is earning nothing for an entire year!). </p>
<p>This is a great observation if you work in a chain letting agent. Otherwise I think it's fairly useless.</p>
<p>90% of the benefit of this insight can be reduced to a discount formula without the need for clever data. If you judge this property will be dormant for 6 weeks you can offer an 11% discount on day 1 for same day move in - you'll lose no money. If you offer only a 9% discount - you're making marginally more money over the year (if you can do the same trick next year).</p>
<p>But also worth remembering in some cases you would have filled the place at the higher rate in less than the expected time, making the benefits to landlords more uncertain. If I'm an amateur landlord I don't think I'd be convinced. </p>
<p>This would also be inconvenient for most tenants as the limiting factor will be when the previous tenancy expires ("start a tenancy sooner cheaper!" "Ok... but I'm still paying for the old one" "But you're paying less money for a small crossover window - moving is more convenient" "But if I'm essentially getting free weeks at the start of the tenancy then what I'm doing is trading stability now (having the property) for stability later (11 month tenancy)" "Oh whatever")</p>
<p>There will of course be some tenants who really do need to move in the next few days but are balking at the price - the combination of these with a fresh let is the perfect environment for this trick to work.  But are there enough of these people to justify a business? Especially seeing as your system only makes sense to customers on both sides only at certain points in their cycle? I'm sceptical.</p>
<p>I think the only actors who can actually do more than marginally well are those who can encounter these rare beasts and spread their bet on when this is actually speeding up the process or if the property would have filled anyway. If you are a stable letting agent with a decent portfolio this is a good idea. Letting agents could offer discounts in letting fees or free services (end of tenancy cleaning for instance) and make up for it with the increased yield from the landlord from fewer fallow periods. Over many properties (and over a number of years) this starts to actually add up.</p>
<p>So this is a classic example of having an insight but being in wrong place to do anything about it (and it's probably hard to exploit even if you are).</p>
<p>But ignoring all that. Let's say this works (and quickly!) and this time next year there is far less idle time and tenants are paying slightly less. Fantastic! The year after this, are rents higher or lower? And the year after? Does better temporal use of housing space actually house more people?</p>
<p>As I see it data based solutions to the rental market are, best case, a slightly more efficient way of bailing a ship that only has its mast above water. The power dynamics at work here are too strong to solve by being slightly cleverer. I think it'd be great if I was wrong about that, I'm a clever person with access to spreadsheets! It'd be really nice if that could help. But in housing I adopt the weak data sceptic position: Some problems can't be solved with data and this is one of them.</p>
<p>(The strong data sceptic position is that most problems can't be solved with more data. There's probably something to it.)</p>
