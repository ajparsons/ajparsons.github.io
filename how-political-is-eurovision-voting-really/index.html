					<p>The goal with this post was to see if I&nbsp;could come up in a morning with
a quick method to test the 'politicalness' of eurovision voting. &nbsp;To
keep it simple I assumed that most 'political' voting was related to
cultural factors that would map onto geographical proximity and so the
question became 'Would countries give higher points to countries closer
to them than those further away'?&nbsp;Using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/Eurovision2010">this
dataset</a> of all results from
1998-2009 and the results from the Wikipedia pages for
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010">2010</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011">2011</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012">2012</a>, I
created a single dataset of all votes cast since 1998. Then I made a
list for each eurovision country of all other eurovision countries they
shared a border with. For countries bordering seas, I counted all
countries with reasonable straight lines across the water (erring on the
side of being over generous). From this I created a new variable
representing the degrees of separation between the source and
destination of all votes (where 1 means they share a border, 2 means
there’s one country in the middle and so on). This dataset is
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjeRO7qR270JdFhxSHU3ZVBNSG1MTXQ5aHZhZkhZamc#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>A robust regression shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship at the 1% level where each less degree of separation
between A and B increases the number of points transferred from A to B
by 0.39(±0.068). The exact coefficient varies year on year and the
relationship drops from significance in 1998 and 2001. As the first few
‘hops’ are likely to be the most important (it’s doubtful the hop from 4
to 5 degrees of separation is a serious consideration for anyone), it’s
worth re-running the regression looking only at if countries share a
border or not. From this we get another significant relationship where a
country will give around 1.9(±0.245) more points to countries it shares
a border with than those it won’t.</p>
<p>While it's nice to have a number on this we’re only explaining a few
percent of the overall vote transfer (2.6% when using all degrees
of&nbsp;separation&nbsp;and 4.6% when only using border/noborder) and it’s not at
all clear that ‘degrees of separation' &nbsp;are the best measurement of
geographic effects. Would the effect be larger or smaller if I was less
generous with borders over seas? Should we be looking at ‘regions’,
countries that share a language? This analysis used all votes cast, but
not all countries are regular players - the relationship might be
different if it was cut down to those who vote every time.</p>
<p>At this point rather than plough on, &nbsp;I decided to look up if anyone had
ever done any proper work on&nbsp;eurovision and found that of course they
have and a great common thread in these is some kind of justification
for having bothered to study something like Eurovision in the first
place.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>
is arguing Eurovision can be used to create a cultural structural
analysis of the post iron-curtain Europe and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn et
al</a> that the
&quot;Eurovision&nbsp;network&nbsp;is analogous to a range of other complex dynamic
networks involving&nbsp;the&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;of goods and opinions&quot;...which are
clearly just excuses.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn, Suleman, Efstathiou and
Johnson</a> (2006) looked at
Eurovision as a network in terms of &nbsp;how in sync countries are with each
other i.e. how similarly are their votes distributed when you ignore
their votes towards each other. They found that the UK was actually the
most 'in sync' with&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;in general between 1992 and 2003 and while
there were patterns that vindicated my geographical links such&nbsp;Estonia
being associated with the Nordic countries, others raise serious
problems with it such as Spain being absent from the group that includes
France and&nbsp;Portugal.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>(1995
- so an older study of a very different eurovision) similarly look at
network effects breaks down eurovision countries into &quot;five meaningful
cliques&quot;, which are further combined into Western, Northern and
Mediterranean blocs (where the last feels like a 'and the rest' bloc)
and that the then supremacy of countries in the Western Bloc was a
result of three of the most&nbsp;strongly&nbsp;knit cliques are located within it.
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=884379">Ginsburgh and
Noury</a>(2004)
is the closest to a more developed version of my attempt, looking at the
effect of cultural and linguistic proximity (which geographic proximity
would at best be acting as a proxy for) on points and finding that a)
these are important factors that far exceed the effects of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> and b) that the
'quality' of the song tends to have quite a large effect on the results.</p>
<p>So in a most boring answer, Eurovision turns out to be actually about
the music. But that's the numbers for you.</p>
