					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/100322-cam1-300x149.jpg" />This is clearly a Question To Which The Answer Is No, but bear
with me a minute. While researching for my Masters dissertation I spent
some time looking at how various&nbsp;countries&nbsp;deal with accuracy
requirements in&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising - I might convert some of my
conclusions into blog form at some point but in the meantime I'll share
a complaint I found quite funny. In New Zealand rules about accuracy in
broadcast and print apply to&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising (although this is a
rare event) and looking through the 2008 cases I found a wonderful
complaint to their Advertising Standards Agency by a man who claimed
that then PM Helen Clark was misleading the electorate by using a
photoshopped image of herself on posters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consumer in this instance is the voting public. &nbsp;Clearly what is
represented as the image of Helen Clark is intended to appeal to a
younger less knowledgeable voter. &nbsp;The Labour Party have used this
exaggerated image of a youthful vibrant younger woman as the face of
the Party to mislead the voting decisions of a less knowledgeable
group.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The visual image in the Billboard is clearly intended to mislead,
and the standard has been set by your sister organisation – the BSA
in its ruling against TV3[*]. &nbsp;They had nothing to gain from using
an actor to voice over an interview, the Labour Party have
everything to gain from misleading the voting public – even if only
by a few votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ASA rejected this, arguing that &quot;it was common practice in a
wide-range of sectors for people to take additional care with their
appearance when their image was used for publicity purposes&quot; - what
makes this extra wonderful is that the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;appealed this
decision, arguing that using photoshopped images was so deceitful it
brought the integrity of the whole party into question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Labour Party has framed Election 08 around the issue of Trust.
This is probably the most important election we as a nation has
faced for many years. As such every vote cast is important and the
voting public need to be protected from the misleading visual image
projected in the billboards (and other media).</p>
<p>A commercial trader potently can make financial gain by presenting
goods or services with professionally enhanced images. By way of
example if a used car dealer advertised an image of a vehicle that
looked pristine, then when it was inspected it was found to have
rust, mismatched paint, and no mag wheels, then the dealer is in
breach of the guidelines and consumer laws. Your august body acting
on the initiative of a complaint from the public would review the
standards and apply a ruling to remove the offending advertisement.</p>
<p>In summary, as a concerned citizen I feel compelled to act and voice
my opinion that the political party trying to project &quot;Trust&quot; as the
major focus of this election is able to knowing promote itself with
a visual presentation that is clearly and intentionally designed to
mislead a segment of the voting public and gain the favour of those
less knowledgeable. As such the billboards in question breach the
standard set out in Rule 2.</p>
<p>This is not just another advertisement by a dodgy car dealer or a
dramatization from an enthusiastic broadcaster - it is vital that
this appeal is considered carefully as it has serious and far
reaching implications for the future of New Zealand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which didn't find much favour with the appeal board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Acting Chairperson said that the identity of the Advertiser in
this Advertisement was clear, both through the authorisation
statement, the use of the identifiable party colours and name, and
through the image of the leader of the party. Regarding the question
of fact and opinion, the Acting Chairperson agreed that this element
of Rule 11 was not raised by this Advertisement. Accordingly she
ruled the Advertisement met the requirements of Rule 11 was not in
breach of it.</p>
<p>The Acting Chairperson took into account the Complainant’s concerns,
however, she was of the view, that <strong>as the Prime Minister and
leader of Labour Party, the public profile of the Rt Hon Helen
Clark, across a wide range of media, was such that the general
public would be familiar with her appearance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there's a fair case to be made that this complaint has a degree
of sexism and well as ageism to it, I find it hard (not impossible) to
imagine the same 'people wouldn't vote her if they knew she was ooolldd'
being levelled against a male&nbsp;politician? Comparing a politician's&nbsp;image
to a rusty car seems an especially thin point - when you buy a car, you
buy the car, when you vote a politicians you're not 'buying' their body.
Years later,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10824495">someone made a similar complaint to the UN ethics
office</a>&nbsp;about
a picture of her on a UN website and there's a definite&nbsp;ugliness&nbsp;about
this kind of complaint.&nbsp;We laugh about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/david-cameron-campaign-poster-rumour">Cameron
poster</a>,
but don't say it calls into question his fundamental character.</p>
<p>On the other hand, isn't it quite nice that even
this&nbsp;frivolous&nbsp;complaint was taken seriously and given (and as
the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;says, prompt) consideration?</p>
<p>* This relates to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/2752">a
decision</a> by the NZ BSA
that a broadcast that declared&nbsp;an interview used an actor's voice, but
didn't declare the silhouetted&nbsp;figure was itself an actor was in breach
of accuracy rules.</p>
