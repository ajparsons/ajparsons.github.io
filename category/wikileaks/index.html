					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikileaks_logo.svg"><img alt="Wikileaks logo" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Wikileaks_logo.svg/120px-Wikileaks_logo.svg.png" /></a>One of the things I'm interesting in at the moment is
how through the internet we're seeing a form of activist emerge, looking
to change the world through fairly untraditional means. As some of the
most high profile and interesting examples, I'm going to look at
Wikileaks and Facebook.&nbsp;My starting point is the idea that both of these
are projects that attempt to utilize the power of technology to create
social change without the need for a large consensus in favour of that
change. Assange is much easier than Zuckerberg to examine in this
respect because he's quite publicly explored and written down exactly
what he believes and intends to accomplish and Wikileaks is quite
clearly conceived of as a way to achieve these ends (whereas while
Facebook is underpinned by various philosophies, I suspect it wasn't
conceived of as a means to an end in quite the same way).</p>
<p>Aaron Bady has a fantastic exploration of his
ideas&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/">here</a>,
but as he says
Assange's&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf">original</a>&nbsp;is
quite readable. His basic premise is that most governments and
organisations can be understood as conspiracies (with an explicit
parallel to how terrorist networks have been modelled) that will create
ways to communicate in secret. Having an environment where secrets can
be kept makes it more likely that things that need to keep secret will
occur (typically bad things) and so we want methods of destroying these
conspiracies. The traditional method of destroying important nodes (e.g.
assassination of key figures) is not always hugely effective if the
network can route round them (plus it's frowned upon in politic society)
so Assange focuses on how the links between conspirators can be
disrupted to erode and reduce the 'total conspiratorial power' of the
network. While that essay doesn't look at the idea of leaks
specifically, Wikileaks quite clearly fits neatly into that role.</p>
<p>It's helpful to look at this through a specific example, so let's think
about how 'cablegate' fits in. It's a nice point of irony the reason why
this leak was possible at all was the realisation in the US intelligence
community of the issue that more secure communication is not always the
most effective communication, one of the conclusion that came out of the
9/11 commission was that a fair amount of useful information existed but
was being kept in closed silos by various different agencies and that a
system that sharing information needed to be used more. This led
to&nbsp;massive expansion in the use of SIPRNet to the point it's now
accessible in a large amount of embassies and US military bases, and
while we can't say how many people have physical access to the system in
1993 at least&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/28/siprnet-america-stores-secret-cables">three
million</a>&nbsp;had
the 'secret' clearance that would have given them the right to view it
and there's no particular reason to think that's decreased by a huge
degree ( for scale, that's around 1% of the current US population). The
electronic nature means that it's possible to steal what would once have
been a warehouse of data out in something that fits in your pocket and
while there are also safeguards in place to detect and prevent people
doing exactly what Manning is accused of doing, there are suggestions
that this was turned off as it was inconvenient for people using the
system (The problem in microcosm: greater secrecy again getting in the
way of an efficient system.)</p>
<p>The interesting bit of Assange's thinking is not the familiar trade-off
between convenience/openness and secrecy/security but how he intends to
use that to get the conspiracy to destroy itself. He argues that a
conspiracy that's communication is compromised will lock down further,
reducing its own ability to organise and conspire that will ultimately
lead to it either losing the ability to function at all or reduce its
ability to fight off outside threats. As Bady put it:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead, he is trying to strangle the links that make the conspiracy
possible, to expose the necessary porousness of the American state's
conspiratorial network in hopes that the security state will then
try to shrink its computational network in response, thereby making
itself dumber and slower and smaller.</blockquote>
<p>This endgame and the focus on making the links between conspirators
untrusted explains why these leaks are of a different character to how
we'd normally expect leaks to look. Typically leaks are things
considered by the leaker to be evidence of crimes, bad practice, etc but
in this case while there have been a few juicy tidbits the vast majority
of the leaks are quite boring because for this strategy the content of
the leaks is almost unimportant as it's their very existence that
reduces the trust of the conspirators and makes them turn on the
system[2. The other side of this is that releasing boring information
shows how much information is pointlessly marked secret and can be seen
as part of the argument in favour of more open government, all of us
linked to all of us has greater ‘computational power’ in Assange’s
language and releasing information more freely increases the prospects
of it being combined with other useful information to result better
analysis of that information. This is a view of government openness
framed in terms of efficiency rather than public interest that can be
picked up in a lot in techie discussion on the subject and I might see
if I can explore further in a future post.].</p>
<p>In this case, we can probably expect to see the network close down, by
enforcing the security procedures that already exist or having better
division of access so that people on military bases in Iraq don't have
access to the entire sum of secret knowledge but the interesting
question is if the diplomats will trust any such system or if in future
they'll be more guarded in what they write and just rely on informal
communication for anything they don't want to write down.</p>
<p>This reliance on informal methods will indeed make it dumber, slower and
less able to function – but will it shut down altogether? I suspect not,
the modern state can survive an enormous amount of inefficiency
and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/22/the_us_is_too_secure_for_its_own_good">Stephen Walt's
argument</a>&nbsp;that
through America's overwhelming global dominance its decision making
processes are insulated from even large screw-ups applies here. US
global hegemony and its state's secrecy culture can survive a lesser
functioning diplomatic corp. and there are no real existential threats
on the institution. The 'convince the snake to eat itself' strategy can
only be effective in organisations where there is very small difference
between 'status quo' and 'complete institutional collapse', which I
don't think is the case in a lot of these organisations.</p>
<p>We can see other examples of this in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338038">'postit'
culture</a>&nbsp;it's been suggested has
risen within the British government after FOI came in, where rather than
leave controversial details in documents that may someday be subject to
FOI request (and even ones that won't) these are attached as post-it
notes to the documents, which can safely be discarded at the other end.
Less efficient maybe and terrible for future historians, but it is
unlikely to lead to internal collapse or leave it much more vulnerable
to outside threats. The institution is secure. Fundamentally Wikileaks
represents an attempt to create an institution that in turn creates
institutional change in other organisations. It doesn't seek to directly
destroy secretive norms of behaviour, it seeks to turn them in on
themselves and my thinking is that this will ultimately prove
ineffective as there are many lower levels of function the conspiracy
will be willing to accept.</p>
<p>To return to starting point what I'm trying to get at is that the
internet allows powerful institutions to exist without requiring much in
the way of social support. One man with a Lady Gaga CD can download the
entire backlog of diplomatic cables, and another group can deliver the
largest leak in history to the world. In terms of sheer power, the
internet is a great leveller but what Assange (and as we'll get to,
Zuckerberg) want is norm changes. Wikileaks has the power to disrupt
conspiracies directly by leaking damaging information on them but what
he really wants to able to do is remove the ability to conspire and
prevent future potential conspirators even wanting to – and I think this
a goal I'm&nbsp;skeptical&nbsp;can be accomplished in all cases through the clash
he describes and requires a view on how institutions can be reformed to
openness.</p>
