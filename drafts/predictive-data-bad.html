					<p>I had some fun with machine learning last year. I was working for an events company and trying to see if I could use engagement data to automatically work out if someone would turn up or not.</p>
<p>Turns out I was terrible at working out why people were coming, but much better at working out that they wouldn't. By knowing this I could adjust aggregate results and started getting more realistic predictions. I got some very right! I am a data scientist magician. I got some a little off. Opps?</p>
<p>In the end I settled on a rough range I could be reasonably confident in - but this was too large to really make any real decisions on. The vague result I was coming up was (while neat to pull from raw data) not really better than everyone else's gut.</p>
<p>I still think it's cool I built a gut, but from a business point of view it's fairly pointless. We already had a lot of those.</p>
<p>There's a school of thought that says what I was doing was absolutely the right track: I just needed to gather more information. My machine gut will scale better than everyone else's gut if I just found more firehoses to point at it.</p>
<p>I think this is wishful thinking. We really want machine learning to do the cool things for people-based analysis that we know it can do for more concrete subjects. So the fact that the data is almost universally non-existent, inaccessible or misleading is put to the side.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, I love this story about pidgeons being used to process brain scans. If you ever get stuck in the past you can jump start all kind of research with a sufficiently large pigeon coup.)</p>
<p>There's a famous story about Target.</p>
<p>Now this story is obviously full of crap right? Taboo sex, a father defending honour, a father shamed (by the MACHINE). It feels like a story, and it is one. It graduated from hypothetical to cautionary tale
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/05/target-predict-teen-pregnancy-inside-story.html">http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/05/target-predict-teen-pregnancy-inside-story.html</a></p>
<p>When stories have features that make it especially shareable (sex, disgust, shame), we should generally be suspicious of them. If the odds say it didn't reach you on its merits, chances are it has few merits.</p>
<p>In reality, predictive stuff are quite bad for almost all e-shopping. Here is Amazon trying to market to me:</p>
<p>Now I really like books. Amazon has all my card details on file. I have a device that can only display books bought from Amazon. I can click a single button and it will take my money and instantly give me a book on that device.</p>
<p>And Amazon is marketing the same book I don't want to me three times.</p>
<p>Ever bought an oven (or similar, infrequent purchase)? Were you followed round the internet for weeks by an optimistic algorithm hoping this was just the start of your oven buying spree?</p>
<p>Think about the huge amount of hours invested in making that incredibly complicated process of identification, auctioning and ad display happen. Think about how stupid the outcome is.</p>
<p>This article on the Facebook newsfeed team (whose job is to guess what things your friends have to say you'll find interesting) has a number of telling details, but I liked this one:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2016/01/how_facebook_s_news_feed_algorithm_works.html</a></p>
<p>&gt;Over the past several months, the social network has been running a test in which it shows some users the top post in their news feed alongside one other, lower-ranked post, asking them to pick the one they’d prefer to read. The result? The algorithm’s rankings correspond to the user’s preferences “sometimes,” Facebook acknowledges, declining to get more specific. When they don’t match up, the company says, that points to “an area for improvement&quot;.</p>
<p>Personalisation like this is a hard trap to see when you falling into it. You start off with excellent data about people's past engagement, but the instant you start using that information to shortcut the process you damage your own information collecting system. They are no longer engaging with things you don't show them. It's cutting off your own legs on the grounds that if you weight less you'll run faster.</p>
<p>To avoid this you'd have to do all sorts of clever tricks to avoid self-reinforcing data, justifying the entire team of clever people.</p>
<p>But what's the result? &quot;Sometimes&quot;.</p>
<p>There are two assumptions that justify the creation of these systems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you have enough information, you can know things about people without asking.</li>
<li>You have enough information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is the temptation to godhood that the processing power available offers. The second should be a rebuff to that, but tends to be forgotten.</p>
<p>In short: Stop trying to sell me ovens, you mortal.</p>
