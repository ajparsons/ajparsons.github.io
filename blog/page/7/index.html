                </h2>
				Mar 12, 2012
                
				
					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motti82/3599285646/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2477/3599285646_c4c8534cef.jpg" /></a>One thing that's not being appreciated enough (because it's
only exciting to a certain kind of wonk) is how the debates about a
Scottish Independence referendum are systematically going through every
disputed concept in the idea of elections. When is the vote? About what?
How will they vote? Especially disputed is the question of who should
vote: All affected interests? By geography? By blood? And now there's
also the question of if people younger than 18 should be given a say in
their national future. If this goes anywhere, it would be the first UK
referendum which expands rather than contracts the electorate (and would
require the development of a separate voting register for this election
which might be interesting).</p>
<p>The one thing still off-limit is breaking the idea that all voters
should count equally - a rule I'll argue further down that breaking
would actually provide quite a neat solution to the problem of lowering
the voting age - but first let's go into the normal arguments for a bit.
Here we have Angela Constance <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/2012/02/01/should-16-and-17-year-olds-vote-in-the-referendum/">making the case
for</a>
letting 16 -and 17-year-olds vote:</p>
<blockquote>
After all, if a 16 year old in Scotland can join the army, get
married and pay taxes – surely he or she should be able to have a
say in this country’s future? That is why in the consultation Your
Scotland, Your Referendum, we are seeking views on extending the
right to vote in this referendum to 16 and 17 year olds who are
eligible to be included on the electoral register.</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual trio brought up to demonstrate the unfairness of the
current voting age. The object here is to show that we are in some way
being inconsistent in handling the maturity of 16 year olds without
relying on the slippery slope of 'maturity'. In Scotland the marriage
thing holds (In England and Wales there's a parental consent requirement
below 18) but the army item has gotten more tenuous as although 16 year
olds can join the army <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defencemanagement.com/feature_story.asp?id=15592">they're not actually allowed to deploy anywhere
till they're
18</a>.</p>
<p>The tax argument is worth going into. The idea that there's a connection
between taxation and representation is an old one but not necessarily a
particularly good one to demonstrate inconsistency - being consistent on
it would require us to do far more than allow 16-year-olds to vote. For
a start, we actually let children pay taxes far earlier than 16, any
time a child saves up and buys anything with VAT they're tax-payers.
True at 16 someone can work full time and pay income tax, but there's no
real reason to connect this kind of tax to the franchise and no other.
From the other end we don't take away the right to vote from adult
unemployed people or those in full-time education who similarly have the
potential to be tax-payers but aren't. To be consistent, if it's the
ability to pay tax that's important we must enfranchise anyone who can
earn and spend anything, or if we are treating income tax as a special
case then we need to disenfranchise anyone who is not paying income tax
(in which case the Lib Dem policy of raising the personal threshold
wouldn't be a way of relieving the tax burden on the poorest but a
sneaky way of disenfranchising them).</p>
<p>What this argument is basically getting at is the idea that we have a
norm for granting a set of rights at 16 and voting rights should be
included in it. This is a helpful argument for advocates of lowering the
voting age because it allows an appeal to precedent and doesn't rely
directly on the nebulous idea of 'maturity' - a problematic idea because
there's inevitably only a small difference between each age cohort
making it hard to draw the process to a stop (if we let 18 year olds,
why not 17? And if them why not 16? And if them, why not... and so on).</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that it's hard to see why this logic doesn't
also apply to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/kccentral/yourvoice/yourrights/yourrightsat18.aspx">any other
right</a>
gained at 18. The basic challenge of 'we grant right X at 16, how is it
just that we grant right Y at 18?' applies to all of them. If children
are considered mature enough to have opinions on keeping Trident, why
shouldn't they be allowed to buy fireworks? Taken to its conclusion this
is saying is that adulthood begins at 16, not that children should vote.</p>
<p>There's not necessarily anything wrong with this idea, a society based
on this would be different but not unthinkable, but accepting this puts
an end to the idea of graduated maturity. <a class="reference external" href="http://ann.sagepub.com/content/633/1/141">Andrew Rehfeld
argues</a> that the defining
feature of childhood maturity isn't that it is or isn't present but that
it is 'in development' and I think this chimes with how many people
instinctively feel about the subject. Many 16 year olds are on average
probably mature enough to be citizens, but 18 year olds are on average
more so and 14-year-olds on average less so - hence a structure that
grants legal rights at intervals and removes qualifications on rights as
a person ages seems to fit nicely into this. So given this, how should
voting rights be handled? Highest bundle? Lowest? Rehfeld leans on the
idea of California state senator John Vasconcellos, who argued that
rather than debate at which point we turn on voting rights, we should do
it gradually and give fractional votes to citizens under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Rehfeld actually goes far further than most child voting supporters, not
simply arguing that 16-year-olds should have half a vote until they turn
18, but that we should go far lower and each year from 12 a person
should gain 1/7 of a vote until they have their full vote at 18
(Vasconcellos's fractions were <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Wheels_for_Citizenship">different but same basic
idea</a>).
The basic idea of gradualism I think is a good one because it sidesteps
the problem of a 'race to the bottom' above as this approach reflects
differences in maturity rather than similarities.&nbsp;Practically the vote
count would be different but not&nbsp;unmanageable&nbsp;and could still be done
with a hand count - at it's most basic you could use&nbsp;separate&nbsp;registers
for each birth year, colour-code the voting slips and then count these
votes&nbsp;separate&nbsp;from the main piles. Counting the different cohorts in
series would add little difficulty over simply increasing the number of
voters.</p>
<p>Now that some people should have greater voting power than others is a
commonly-had and commonly-rejected idea. Ultimately that each person has
one vote is a compromise, as any other scheme arguing that certain
citizens are wiser and so should have greater voting powers would not be
generally accepted and so would undermine rather than enrich the
democratic process. I think children are a special case in this sense as
the fractional vote represents a process rather than permanent division.
It's not an argument that a certain race or gender's votes are worth
less, or that any particular&nbsp;qualification&nbsp;should give more voting power
- simply that children start off immature and progress towards maturity
and they should have a voting power that reflects this reality.&nbsp;It
allows for what I think is a reasonably common sense view on the
maturity of children to be expressed, while at the same time recognizing
that children represent real interests (that are distinct from any other
group) and should have a say in matters.</p>
<p>Even as a reduced voting block this would still introduce
a&nbsp;sizeable&nbsp;number of people to the electorate so the result is far from
a token vote, and as a result children would grow and be socialized into
citizenship rather than having it thrust on them all at once. This is a
more radical approach than votes at 16, but I think it ultimately
accomplishes the same aims better and - rather than creating a new
voting age with the same justifications waiting in the wings to lower it
again - would create a future-proof framework for dealing with child
voters. Best case, this gives us a political system more tuned to the
needs and concerns of the young (and by proxy, future generations) and
more children who enter adulthood as politically aware individuals.
Worst case, we add a few more voters to the large number who already
have no idea what they're doing. &nbsp;On the basis of that highly slanted
weighing up of the facts, it'd be silly not to think about it.</p>

					<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EYhVwPqCQ">this video</a>
emerged on the Internet of Boris Johnson being chased outside City Hall
by a man in a chicken suit:</p>
<p>As it turns out this chicken isn't even chasing the actual Boris, giving
us a man wearing a chicken suit chasing a man dressed a man with a fake
blonde wig, being&nbsp;filmed with a shaky camera for authenticity. It's a
strange world we live in, but stranger still is that following
politicians while wearing chicken-suits has a long and proud&nbsp;history.
&nbsp;As far as I can tell, it started in America when Gerald Ford <a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/120064/tales-of-a-serial-prankster-interviewing-the-president-while-wearing-a-chicken-suit/">addressed
the chicken
mascot</a>
of a local radio station while on campaign - a New York Times reporter
then promptly bought the costume off the station and showed up to a
press event in it as a prank (<a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/22347153">video
here</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/chicken-300x173.png:target:/uploads/chicken.png" /></p>
<p>The chicken then went dormant for a while, reappearing in 1992 <a class="reference external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5NGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4586,977613">working
for
Clinton</a>&nbsp;(great
illustration in that article) as 'Chicken George', but this time around
the chicken had a political objective. The job of this chicken was hound
George H. W. Bush for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/news/01iht-deba.html">stonewalling debate
negotiations</a>&nbsp;and
this has been a recurring use of chicken suits since. This version of
the chicken I'm assuming is the inspiration for events in&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/sixth/615fredonia.html">season six
of the West
Wing</a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;Josh
Lyman similarly deploys&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;in chicken suits to hound opponents
who wouldn't debate his candidate.</p>
<p>The Chicken crossed the Atlantic for the 1997 election, giving us the
'Tory Chicken', who followed Tony Blair to highlight that he had
declined to debate John Major. For some reason this triggered a
previously unknown British capacity for animal-suit politics, spawning a
fox to chase the chicken off and a rhinoceros&nbsp;opposed to the idea of
animal suits entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chicken was to follow the Labour leader, who was campaigning in
the marginal Tory seat held by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary. However, his efforts to henpeck Mr Blair were hampered by
a man from the Scottish Daily Mirror dressed as Freddy the Fox, who
blocked his path during a 15-minute walkabout.</p>
<p>As Mr Blair approached, the chicken was seen to stumble and was
pushed to the back of the crowd surrounding the Labour leader, where
it waved a placard before skulking off. A jubilant Freddy observed:
&quot;I had him for dinner. I stopped him getting anywhere near Tony.
Tony shook my hand and thanked me for it.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Mr Blair's guardian refused to identify himself, saying:
&quot;The whole thing is embarrassing enough as it is.&quot; The incident came
at the end of a traumatic day for the Tory chicken. Earlier, he got
into a nasty fight with a rival chicken with a detachable head, sent
by the Mirror newspaper, as he strutted across College Green in
Westminster. He was also pursued across London by another fox, two
teddy bears and a plastic rhinoceros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/rantext/random-politics/the-tory-chicken-loses-its-head">That whole
article</a>
is worth a read if only for the full description of the Chicken's fight
with the Mirror Chicken (the Mirror would go on to send another chicken
<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8633049.stm">after

probably others&nbsp;in the 2010 election).&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Finkelstein has a good
story about having to keep the Chicken motivated during the campaign,
but it's sadly now lost behind the Times paywall. In happier
news,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://takingliberties.squarespace.com/taking-liberties/2010/4/18/class-of-97-tony-blair-and-the-tory-chicken.html">here's the
story</a>
of its visit to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Chickens have also popped up in
<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.canoe.ca/raisinghell/general/doer-smarter-than-your-average-chicken/">Canadian&nbsp;provincial&nbsp;elections</a>
so there's a fair chance&nbsp;I've missed several chicken sightings but the
idea of using chickens to draw attention to lack of debates (and assign
blame) seem to be a recurring thing here. Given this back story, what do
we make of this latest chicken? &nbsp;That the real Boris doesn't even appear
in Ken's chicken's videos so far (and that it's not explained in video
why there's a chicken) is interesting as the chicken&nbsp;usually&nbsp;tries to
muscle in on it's target's event and steal the focus.&nbsp;Is chasing fake
Boris a sign of laziness or a sign that the media landscape is changing
and our use of chicken suits with it? &nbsp;Do&nbsp;we now understanding a chicken
suit as short-hand for dodging debates? Or does the lack of context of
the clip&nbsp;reflect the changing face of media, that it's now better to get
a short and intriguing video on the internet and draw people to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.borisjohnshen.com/">your
site</a> than to try and worm in at your
opponent's own media events?</p>
<p>For entirely unrelated reasons, <a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/203347/voting-in-nevada-dont-wear-a-chicken-suit">you can't vote in a chicken-suit in
Nevada</a>.</p>

					<p>The<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-16561604">BBC
reports</a>
that Westminster is claiming a Scottish&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum wouldn't
be able to use the full electoral roll, which seems a bit strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: &quot;The UK government has
set out very clearly that the Scottish government cannot legislate
lawfully for a referendum with its current powers.</p>
<p>&quot;The full electoral register can only be used for specific purposes
such as the general or Holyrood elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The legal position is clear - if the SNP attempts to go ahead with
its own referendum then it will be nothing more than an opinion
poll, with a million Scots unable to be asked for their view.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true this means many potential voters could be excluded as they're
not on the&nbsp;publicly&nbsp;available (reduced) register. As a layman I've had a
quick skim of some of the acts related to the electoral register and
according to the explanatory note of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1872/note/made">Representation of the People
(Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations
2002</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
A copy of the full version of the register may not be supplied by a
registration officer otherwise than in accordance with an enactment
(which, by virtue of the definition in inserted regulation 92(2),
includes subordinate legislation) including the principal
Regulations (inserted regulation 94(3)).</blockquote>
<p>The effect of which includes an enactment to be &nbsp;'any provision of, or
of any instrument made under, an&nbsp;Act of the Scottish Parliament' via
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/2/contents">Representation of the People Act
2000</a>. &nbsp;Which,
again I might be misreading, I take to mean the Scottish Parliament can
in principle have referenda using the electoral roll. If they can use it
for even a non-binding question about a reserved power is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/nov/08/uk-supreme-court-scottish-independence">contested</a>.</p>
<p>As Matt Qvortrup&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/dr_matt_qvortrup_scotland_does_not_need_permission_to_go_it_alone_1_2047506">sort of
argues</a>in
the Scotsman, the international recognition of self-determination (which
I think is less strong than he suggests, but going with it) would likely
mean in the event that Scotland holds a democratically legitimate but
illegal referendum, it would likely have to be recognised by Westminster
- which is why moves to&nbsp;de-legitimize&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;vote by arguing
people will be excluded make sense, and as I've said before the SNP
should be careful to avoid <a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">ambiguous questions that give rise to these
kinds of
challenges</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ah, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/referendum/4093-conservative-scaremongering-over-electoral-register-dismissed-as-qnonsenseq">clearer
copy</a>
of SNP statement that seems to support my point.</p>
<blockquote>
However a spokesperson for the Scottish government rejected Mr
Mundell's and noted that the referendum would be carried out after
the appropriate legislation was passed at Holyrood, ensuring full
access to the register.</blockquote>

					<div><p>I went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/parliamentary_boundary_review">a talk by Ron Johnston, Charles Pattie and David
Rossiter</a>
at the Constitution Unit yesterday on the in-progress boundary reviews
(their slides at link). It was interesting in the sense that it
confirmed with figures the kind of problems they’d previously predicted
with the review and I’m just going to throw down a few notes while it’s
fresh in my mind.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="building-blocks-and-displacement">
<h2>Building blocks and displacement</h2>
<div><p>This review represents the triumph, though possibly only temporarily, of
the mathematical principle (all constituencies should have equal numbers
of electors) over the organic principle (constituencies should reflect
real communities and locations) with a tighter than ever constraint on
elector numbers. A basic problem of requiring constituency electors to
fall within a certain range is that the building block used (wards) are
too often too big to construct constituencies within the range.</p>
<p>Interestingly the English and Scottish commissions have different ways
of dealing with this, the English method being to cross borders to make
up the numbers, whereas the Scottish commission splits wards. &nbsp;They
pretty conclusively demonstrated the Scottish method is less disruptive,
measured by relative numbers of ‘suboptimally&nbsp;placed (SP) electors’, who
are electors displaced from the majority of their compatriots in their
local authority, old constituency or ward. This does make sense
intuitively, as crossing borders pushes the imbalance over into the next
region and requires aggregate more slight movements of voters, but it’s
good to have numbers on it.</p>
<p>The idea that SPs should be minimized is a good measure, but I wonder if
the principle could be extended. If the proposed ‘one review a
parliament’ schedule is kept up, in the worst case you could find voters
who are moved around at every election - another possible measure would
be to try and minimize the number of people who have been SPs more than
once (TSPs?).</p>
<p>As the general trend is towards larger wards, they suggested using
polling districts as a possible smaller building block. The other option
they suggested in 2009 (with McLean) was

<div class="section" id="public-hearings-and-political-effects">
<h2>Public Hearings and political effects</h2>
<div><p>It was interesting to hear that the public hearings (essentially
curtailed versions of the public inquires) are still a vehicle for
parties even if their&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to input has been reduced (limited to 40
minute slots). This isn’t entirely surprising as parties have the
greatest interest in the result - I’m going to bring in here a bit here
something I wrote at the time the bill was going through about the
relationship between parties and the inquiries:</p>

    <div>

 As boundary matters are decided in the UK by the apolitical Boundary
 Commission, what happens is whenever we have a debate about
 apportionment it rapidly becomes a debate about competing metrics of
 fairness, where each side just so happens to align with the position
 that's seen to result in a better deal for them. Natural population
 movement tends to lead to more boundaries that favour Labour over
 time and so in general Labour has been opposed both to frequent
 redistributions and now, very clearly, stricter equalisation. It's
 not a coincidence that it's the same party that postponed the
 acceptance of new boundaries until after the election in 1969 is now
 dragging it's feet in the Lords but equally the Conservative
 position isn't much deeper, if situations were reversed I've no
 doubt we'd see the same in the other direction. However, that a
 position has political advantages doesn't stop it being a correct
 one.

 …

 It's interesting that one of concessions given in the Lords seems to
 be `the return of public
 inquiries <http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6661493/wheeling-and-dealing-over-the-av-bill.thtml>`__
 as I thought that removing them was one of the more interesting
 elements of the plan. Public inquiries have a number of issues, they
 make the process very time consuming (which is an issue if we're
 going to have to have a review every parliament), tend to increase
 deviations from the quota size, but most importantly public inquires
 are one of the few ways for political parties to influence the
 decision of the Boundary Commission. What you sometimes get is that
 political parties will show up at the Inquiry with alternate plans,
 which as long as they fulfil the commission's criteria better than
 the Commission's own plan it has no grounds to reject on the basis
 that it's more partisan[1. Lots of interesting discussion of this in
 D. J Rossiter, R.J Johnson, and C. J Pattie, The Boundary
 Commissions: Redrawing the UKʼs map of Parliamentary Constituencies,
 (Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2009), pp. 246-262] .
 Being apolitical means it can't consider the political consequences
 of its work, this is far from saying there are none. Given the
 inherent political nature of their work, Richard Morill `makes the
 interesting
 argument <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X2W-4XSF2CP-3&_user=10&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F1987&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1626703844&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d2b5fce8f7a5050618d81c54db5a1dcd&searchtype=a>`__
 that political ends should be directly considered by apportionment
 bodies and that they should set out to create certain numbers of
 safe and marginal seats rather than pretending its work has no
 impact on these questions, but its hard to see this view gaining
 much currency in British circles.

<div class="section" id="relationship-to-electoral-system">
<h2>Relationship to electoral system</h2>
<div><p>Something that was danced around in the Q&amp;A is the way in which the
boundary commission is related to the voting system. In many way the
boundary commission is the dark and complicated back-end of the ‘simple’
FPTP system (or any single-member system like AV) in that single-member
constituencies are smaller than multi-member constituencies, and so are
more vulnerable to population shifts (and the problem of building block
size mentioned earlier), plus the all-or-nothing nature of the systems
make the partisan implications of boundaries a bigger issue than they
might otherwise be. This isn’t a hugely live issue (as was pointed out
the boundary proposals might be unpopular among MPs but changing the
voting system is even more so) but it’s worth remembering it all fits
together.</p>
<p>While district magnitude and electoral system have effects on the
importance of boundaries, something that’s thought about less is that
ultimately the conflict between the organic and mathematical criteria
are the result of the fixing representative voting weight at ‘1’.
&nbsp;Trying to express both through the same measure (boundaries) inevitably
requires one to be prioritized over the other, what we need to do is
open up another stream to get the information into the chamber.</p>
<p>What Toplek
<a class="reference external" href="http://templelaw.tenintenclients.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toplak.pdf">proposes</a>[2.
Link takes you to pdf, but ref is:&nbsp;Jurij Toplak, ‘Equal voting weight of
all: Finally &quot;One Person, One Vote&quot; from Hawaii to Maine?’, Temple Law
Review, Vol. 81, 2008, pp. 123-178]&nbsp;in the context of the US is rather
than endlessly debate methods of dividing seats among the states on the
basis of their population, use any method but then give a state’s reps a
voting power that is equal to the population of that state. Using
representative voting weight as the means of expressing mathematical
equality frees up the boundary process to deviate in size to allow more
‘natural’ constituencies (even extreme deviations in size could then be
permitted within the system without being exceptions).</p>
<p>This doesn’t resolve all the problems of boundaries (safe seats, etc)
but it does resolve the current debate in a much easier (and cheaper)
way. &nbsp;Beyond that fix, [laying with representative voting weight opens
up a whole new realm of possible electoral structures, including methods
of dynamic apportionment which reduce the need for boundary reviews even
further and more exact methods of proportional representation. But
that’s a matter for future posts.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thos003/5986220278/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6148/5986220278_9635614fc2_m.jpg" /></a>I've been re-reading parts of Scott's '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seeing-Like-State-Condition-Agrarian/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a
State</a>'
for a class, and it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me his basic frame is something that is
useful for&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;various changes in Facebook.&nbsp;One of his recurring
ideas is that the state as it develops&nbsp;homogenizes various features of
the society to allow the 'center' to better gather&nbsp;information&nbsp;about its
capacities and so more effectively govern and rule. This goes from grid
cities eliminating the need for local knowledge and maps to navigate, to
standardization on language to remove the need for local interpreters,
the creation of fixed last names for the purpose of tax collection and
so on - devices that are designed to undermine the importance of local
knowledge and make the society more legible to outsiders.</p>
<p>To a certain extent we can see&nbsp;Facebook take similar paths as it
develops, the most obvious example being when the open-ended 'About Me'
text fields (for interests, sports, movies, music etc) were converted
into a system of links to pages (for various interest, sports, movies,
music, etc) where a user selects which links they want to connect to
their profile.</p>
<p>The old system was very local, I can look at my friends' pages and see
what their interests are and&nbsp;vice&nbsp;versa, it's a system for people who
know each other to share&nbsp;information&nbsp;with each other. While it works
well for one-on-one human interaction, it has a number of disadvantages
for Facebook's position at the center - to&nbsp;find out if someone has 'X'
as in interest, they have to search their database which is time and
resource consuming as most of their lots of users probably don't mention
'X' at all. In addition to that, what if someone spells it wrong? Or
uses a local label, or a variation on it? In those&nbsp;conditions, there is
an awful lot of&nbsp;information&nbsp;inside Facebook that it effectively has no
idea about, because it doesn't have cheap and&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;ways of accessing
it.</p>
<p>If we imagine Facebook as a series of nodes (people, pages), links
between nodes, and prongs (information associated with a single note) -
it is prongs that cause this difficulty for Facebook. From their
perspective it makes sense to try to convert prongs to links because
links are nicely&nbsp;quantifiable&nbsp;and trackable - it's a much simple matter
to find out how many users have linked to 'X', and also how many are
linked to Y'. &nbsp;But this process was a simplification of the range of
expression&nbsp;available&nbsp;to users, done in the interest of making
the&nbsp;information&nbsp;present within&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;more legible to the center. Most
tellingly, similar&nbsp;to how this development in the state is associated
with improved tax collection, better knowledge of its users makes their
knowledge base more valuable to outsiders, who pay Facebook for access
to it. Making people legible is a way of converting them into money.</p>
<p>On a bit of a side-note from that, Facebook often claims that
all&nbsp;information&nbsp;shared with it is entirely&nbsp;voluntary&nbsp;but something you
see sometimes is them attempting to&nbsp;manipulate&nbsp;people to share
certain&nbsp;information&nbsp;through UI design. In one of the re-designs last
year, the&nbsp;employment&nbsp;and education fields jumped out of being hidden on
a back page to being the first thing underneath your name, one of the
most important places on the screen and something you'd be prompted to
fill in everytime you visited your own page. &nbsp;I suspect this is a result
of their decision to switch away from networks as a means of
organisation and privacy control - networks were also a source
of&nbsp;information, if you're in the Durham network you're highly likely to
be a current or recent Durham student (and there were briefly corporate
networks for catching graduates and the general public). By removing the
importance of networks, there's no incentive for people to join networks
and share that&nbsp;information&nbsp;about their education or employment, hence
the quality of their&nbsp;information&nbsp;degraded and they needed to encourage
more people to give them back the&nbsp;information&nbsp;they'd lost through these
other means. Now of course, you still choose if you fill it in or not -
but I bet a lot more people did than who would have otherwise, Facebook
isn't neutral or passive about which&nbsp;information&nbsp;it wants.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/447138298-300x161.jpg" />(This post contains spoilers. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slashfilm.com/spoilers-good-study/">But spoilers are good for
you</a>.)</p>
<p>The first installement of Charlie Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-mirror/">Black
Mirror</a> is, if
nothing else, clever.&nbsp;The name of the anthology&nbsp;itself is clever, being
both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&nbsp;indulge&nbsp;their darker selves. &nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&nbsp;massacre.&nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&quot;)&nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.</p>
<p>I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&nbsp;Chris Applegate <a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp">points
out</a> the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf">Guardian Screen Burn
column</a>&nbsp;(
p191)&nbsp;in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.</p>
</div><div><p>The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div><p>This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.</p>
<p>In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.</p>
<p>UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html">used on the BBC
website</a>).&nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&nbsp;that their&nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.</p>
</div><div><p>That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media">in promotion of Black
Mirror</a>:</p>
</div>

    <div>

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

    </div>

    <div>

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

    </div>

    <div>

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div><p>But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&nbsp;A&nbsp;longer&nbsp;stretch&nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:</p>

<div><p>What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&nbsp;In this sense it's a&nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.</p>
<p>Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&quot;</p>
<p>You pay the licence fee, you decide.</p>
