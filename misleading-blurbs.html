					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx"><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/binladen-300x247.png" /></a>A colouring book setting out to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx">explain 9/11 to
kids</a>
is obviously walking a mine field of every variety, but looking at the
site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.</blockquote>
<p>Which might be taking small liberties with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html">original
intent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.</blockquote>
<p>Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&quot; Bell said. &quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview
with Bell himself.</p>
