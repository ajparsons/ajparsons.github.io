					<p>I've reached the point in my suicide contagion project where new
research is starting to fit very nicely into the final framework (which
hopefully suggests I'm onto something, or alternatively that I've&nbsp;become
blind to contrary information - either/or). Today I read some new
research by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279630540_Crisis_Phones__Suicide_Prevention_Versus_SuggestionContagion_Effects">Stack
(2015)</a>
on if crisis phones on bridges were an effective means of suicide
prevention.</p>
<p>What he found was a little unsettling.&nbsp;We know people use them (good!)
and that these people tend not to&nbsp;jump (also good!) but did suicides on
the bridge increase or decrease after their installation? They&nbsp;rose. Ah,
but did the population increase? No. Did the local suicide rate increase
as well? No it went down. Ah.</p>
<p>Stack draws attention to a blog that covers bridge suicides (as well as
media coverage) that may be responsible in part for people choosing
bridge suicide over another method. But he also notes&nbsp;(if we believe
that 'suggestion' has influence on suicide) we should look carefully at
those&nbsp;phones:</p>
<blockquote>
The suggestion thesis holds that the phones, which were installed
with signs alerting suicidal people that they offer a link to help,
will suggest suicide to vulnerable persons. These at-risk
individuals may otherwise not have thought of suicide off the bridge
(Beautrais, 2007; Glatt, 1987). The suggestion hypothesis assumes
that such signs will affect only vulnerable persons at risk of
suicide. It is unlikely that they would impact healthy person.</blockquote>
<p>This last point is important - given we generally hold that
at-risk&nbsp;people can be negatively affected by messaging we should
consider this even when intentions are good. &nbsp;Research on other public
health interventions show we cannot rule out that things done in good
faith to save lives will end up doing net harm.</p>
<p>Klimes-Dougan and Lee (2010) did a study on if suicide prevention
billboards were effective - finding negative as well as positive
effects.&nbsp;They found their&nbsp;billboard (&quot;Prevent Suicide, Treat Depression
– See your Doctor&quot;&nbsp;) was in general good at getting people to believe
that treating depression was a good way to reduce suicide - but also
that their high-risk group tended to end up with a stronger perceived
link between depression and suicide after viewing a billboard. The worry
here is that being too explicit about the connection to depressed people
encourages a railroading of their future down that path. Their TV ad&nbsp;by
contrast didn't have that effect - it&nbsp;used the phrase &quot;it can even lead
to suicide&quot; as an escalation of symptoms of depression, making death one
of several possible options.</p>
<p>The billboard group also ended up with lower help-seeking scores than
the no-information group (A TV advert did better however, public health
campaigns not completely doomed) - directly encouraging people to seek
help might not have the results you hope&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that&nbsp;this is tricky stuff - the words you use
matter.&nbsp;A workshop on public messages for suicide prevention made the
point that broad campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
Broad-based campaigns that are likely to reach multiple audiences
should determine how subgroups of intended populations (or
nontargeted&nbsp;groups of a population) might have different attitudes
about suicide, and may respond differently to messages geared
towards increasing help-seeking behavior (Cauce&nbsp;et al. 2002).</blockquote>
<p>But also that targeted campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
For example, certain American Indian nations have very high rates of
suicide. A campaign via popular Indian radio stations that
highlights the high prevalence may inadvertently normalize suicide
and send the message that such behaviour is expected and is
inevitable. Groups with high rates may get the message that they
have experienced an expected behaviour, and the groups with lower
rates are simply &quot;lagging behind&quot; on what is seen to be inevitable.</blockquote>
<p>You might say they're just being risk adverse - but we have to
acknowledge that letting words loose into the world with the aim of
saving lives is something we seem to know little about. As Beautrais,
Fergusson, Coogan et al (2007) put it:</p>
<blockquote>
Until there is clear evidence that public health messages about
suicide prevent, and do not normalize, suicide, and have no
deleterious effects, the most prudent approach to this issue is not
to include&nbsp;public health messages as part of a suicide prevention
strategy.</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to print crisis lines after newspaper articles in suicide
- which are pretty clearly public health messages that are advocated
frequently&nbsp;as part of a suicide prevention strategy. &nbsp; Stack brings up
Niederkrontenthaler et al (2010) who found that newspaper stories that
printed the phone number of a crisis link seemed associated with an
increase in suicide rates. Now for the&nbsp;record, the authors were more
sceptical of this result than some of their others (they were checking
for so many things and it was one of their least significant results -
although still p &lt; 0.05) - but I can't find anyone else who has
suggested anything to the contrary.&nbsp;Others have done research on if
suicide lines are effective on those they reach e.g Gould et al (2007)
(answer: yes-ish - reduction&nbsp;in pain and hopelessness, but not an
apparent&nbsp;reduction in intent to die), there seems to be very little work
on if the advertisement of the lines is a good idea.</p>
<p>The problem here is the population who is exposed to the advertisement
but who will not be exposed to any&nbsp;positive effect of the helpline - if
this group contains at-risk individuals (which it does) then there is
the prospect of harm.&nbsp;That printing a suicide number could be
negative&nbsp;is consistent with research that billboards can have a harmful
effect and the idea that&nbsp;crisis phones on bridges&nbsp;might not be
universally fantastic.</p>
<p>That certain wordings of these crisis line adverts might be worse than
others is consistent with the idea that suicide contagion is more
powerful when people can identify (and have similarities) with the
subject of the article. If the wording asks you if you identify&nbsp;(&quot;If
you're affected...&quot; - &quot;ooh, am I?&quot;) it might create or intensify a
one-to-one relationship with the subject of the article upon
introspection. This suggests that they shouldn't be viewed as a
corrective or an addendum to the article but part of the text and so
part of any journey of identification.</p>
<p>There clearly isn't enough evidence to say this is something
papers&nbsp;should stop doing - but I think it's something we need to think
more carefully about.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it worrying I can create a hypothesis
based on the same theoretical framework the rest of contagion works on
-&nbsp;and that's consistent with the evidence we do have - that says we are
possibly making things worse. &nbsp;Even if we take&nbsp;Niederkrontenthaler et
al.'s scepticism seriously and move their result to the 'not proven'
column it is deeply concerning that we have almost no&nbsp;positive evidence
we can point to and say &quot;printing the phone number makes the suicide
rate go down&quot;&nbsp;. The idea&nbsp;that the message can never have a negative
effect on non-callers needs to have more thought put into it to justify
the pre-eminence of this advice.</p>
<p>Stack's main point is that crisis phones are not a good substitute for
barriers on bridges (just much cheaper). It's not clear what a more
effective alternative to crisis line ads following suicide stories would
be. I find the fact that most people who suffer from suicidal thoughts
end up not taking their own life a reassuring idea&nbsp;- a disclaimer built
around this idea encourages identification with the living rather than
the dead (and creates a universe larger than the reader and the subject)
could be an approach to explore. But there's no evidence on if this
would be a good approach&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>The final section of my project will deal more generally with how little
evidence there is for a lot of suggested interventions - but I wanted to
share a glimpse into just how much of an unknown doing anything
'positive' in this area can be.</p>

					<p>An
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2015/01/if-you-believe-trans-lives-matter-dont-share-leelah-alcorns-suicide-note-social">article</a>&nbsp;went
up on The New Statesman today arguing&nbsp;that people sharing the suicide
note of a trans-person were actually endangering the very people they
were trying to raise awareness of. This is&nbsp;based on The Samaritans
guidelines&nbsp;that journalists should&nbsp;not print the content of suicide
notes because of the idea of 'suicide contagion' - arguing that
including details of suicide notes can make it more likely people will
try and emulate the note's author.</p>
<p>My opinion of the Samaritan’s guidelines is
they offer&nbsp;good generalised advice that should be read and often
followed. That said, specific guidance is often detached from supporting
evidence and shouldn't be used as an authority to beat people with.
There are circumstances where blindly following guidance has the
potential to do harm and I think this is one of them.</p>
<p>To understand why the contagious understanding of the suicide note is a
bit narrow we need to know a bit more history. I go into this in far
more detail in the finished piece but my basic premise is that over the
last few centuries’ media coverage of suicide played a significant part
in making us a better, kinder&nbsp;society&nbsp;more understanding of
those&nbsp;amongst us most in pain.</p>
<p>To quickly summarise historian Michael MacDonald’s argument [1] -
newspapers secularised suicide by making it a mundane fact of life. The
syndication of suicide stories made the fact of suicide a constant
low-level noise as opposed to something that would happen in smaller
communities incredibly infrequently. From stories of the devil stalking
the earth and taking lives, suicide was enveloped in statistical
reporting. Coverage was often (but not universally) sympathetic. The
focus on the stories of individuals and a large written audience for
stories about suicide created the literary genre of the suicide note
(sometimes helped along&nbsp;by journalists providing them when absent).
Through these notes people tried to shape the narrative of their death
for their community and the wider world.</p>
<p>In step with these developments came near total resistance to sanctions
for the deceased or their survivors, which led to subsequent law
changes. Naturally social change was more complicated than that but the
role of newspapers was important. They made the reader’s world bigger
and the quietest voices louder.</p>
<p>Working from that history I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is
always wrong to print suicide notes and that no good can come of
reporting suicides.</p>
<p>There isn’t a reason given in the Samaritans guide as to why suicide
notes shouldn’t be reported, but working from the general theory
of&nbsp;suicide contagion the fear is that it risks increasing identification
with the deceased and identification might lead to&nbsp;imitation. I dislike
the view that suicide notes should only be seen as infectious spores.
They might also be the last way to understand a person&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>While the evidence for suicide contagion exists (more patchy than often
stated, but still worth taking seriously) this doesn’t apply to all
guidelines proposed. Restrictions on printing suicide method are well
evidenced, most other areas are more theoretical (and I suspect often
derive from backwards engineering terrible reporting – printing suicide
notes is in most cases tacky).</p>
<p>There is a small scientific field concerned with analysing suicide notes
but there is very little published on their effect on suicide contagion.
Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues[2] did investigate if citing a suicide
note effected suicide rates but found no effect – and this lack of
outcome merited no discussion. It’s just not a particular active
question in the field. The only area where a suicide note was discussed
at length I can find was an instance where releasing extracts from a
suicide note was seen as positive. I don’t buy this but it’s worth
looking at to understand solid ground is very hard to find here.</p>
<p>The idea of suicide contagion is best established with celebrity
suicides (Stack’s 2005 meta-analysis of the literature found no
ecological effect on suicide rates had been definitively proven outside
of celebrity studies[3]). As such after Kurt Cobain’s suicide there were
a few attempts to detect an effect in suicide rates. These failed to
find an effect (which is a good thing), and the explanations given for
this in the literature are interesting.</p>
<p>Martin, Graham. “Media Influence to Suicide : The Search for Solutions.”
Archives of Suicide Research 4, no. 1 (2007): 51–66:</p>
<blockquote>
One major difference appears to be the attitude actively promoted by
Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, by his family and subsequently by the
media. Immediately following the death Love made an audiotape
containing excerpts from a note left by Cobain; she commented in a
negative fashion on each part (Gaines, 1994, p. 107). For instance;
“I don’t have the passion anymore, so remember – (And don’t, because
this is a f…ing lie) – It’s better to burn out than fade away (God,
you asshole.) (Sandford, 1995, p.244)”</blockquote>
<p>Gould, M S. “Suicide and the Media.” Annals of the New York Academy of
Sciences 932 (April 2001): 200–214 :</p>
<blockquote>
Yet, celebrity suicides do not always yield imitative suicides, as
evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in suicides
following the death of Kurt Cobain. [...] [T]he substantial efforts
by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, to present his suicide in a
negative fashion may have counteracted any potential glamorization
of his death.</blockquote>
<p>The argument essentially goes “there was no imitative effect, therefore
the response did something right”, yet I suspect if you asked Martin if
we should be printing but dismantling suicide notes he wouldn’t argue
for that forcefully. This argument is grasping at straws a little and
paints an overly progressive picture of the media response to Cobain’s
death. If it really was a good response we might need to change media
guides more. After all, the Seattle Times printed a front page image of
Cobain's dead body<a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/126631/how-seattle-times-covered-cobains-death-17-years-ago-today/#more-126631">the next
day</a>on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his picture met that test by establishing an essential reality
about Cobain’s death. Our concern was that Cobain’s suicide would be
romanticized by some – suicide, the ultimate high.</p>
<p>As one editor said, the photo showed, ‘This wasn’t cool, it was
death and that’s the result of suicide.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, media guides would advise against such a thing but they’re
essentially working from the same hymn sheet that you shouldn’t glorify
the dead. Why are the Samaritans right and the Seattle Times wrong?</p>
<p>I want to dismantle the idea of expert opinion a bit here. I don’t think
anyone has any particularly good evidence why there was no detectable
effect after Cobain's suicide and I don’t think anyone has any evidence
that you shouldn’t print suicide notes. I trust well-intentioned people
working at charities trying to save lives a little more than I trust
well-intentioned people who also like to sell newspapers, but simply
having the right&nbsp;intentions is not enough.</p>
<p>Take this situation; we have two sets of well-intentioned people – one
set want to bring wider light to a story in the hope of saving lives,
the other set think this is dangerous because telling this story could
kill more people. This is important stuff, who is right?</p>
<p>Here are the key questions. The Samaritans explicitly state their
guidelines are only advisory;&nbsp;has&nbsp;suicide contagion been demonstrated to
such an&nbsp;extent that there can be no exceptions to guidance? I'd argue
not. Is there any evidence suggesting suicide notes in particular cause
harm? Again, the answer's no.</p>
<p>By all means, be concerned - but let's not pretend anyone knows which
course of action saves more lives.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A side point, but after The Samaritans’ <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users">Radar controversy</a> worth thinking about.</p>
<p>My thinking on this hasn't solidified yet, but there’s a touch of a
paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill in the advice not to
print suicide notes. We’re told “avoid the suggestion that a single
incident […] was the cause” - after all suicide is complicated and often
involves mental illness - but also not to report why they said they did
it. The implication here is that these people were not qualified to tell
you why they were suffering. This is even more unsettling when written
by a member of a group who specifically highlights their treatment as
part of that group: “They can’t know what they’re talking about, they’re
ill.&quot;&nbsp;I think this is accepted uncritically a bit wider than it should
be.</p>

					<p>This is an excerpt from a much longer piece on the history of suicide
and journalism. &nbsp;It contains description of suicide&nbsp;methods only in so
far as they are required to demonstrate the point being made.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Across a number of countries there are media guidelines on suicide
reporting (most voluntary, but New Zealand’s are governed by law). These
arrived in the UK in 2006 when the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)
added a new clause to the Editors’ Code of Practice, extending the
guidelines on reporting on topics likely to involve personal grief with
an explicit prohibition on publishing ‘excessive detail’ about suicide
methods. The article now reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt;5. Intrusion into grief or shock</p>
<p>&gt;i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and
approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication
handled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report
legal proceedings, such as inquests.</p>
<p>ii) When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive
detail about the method used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule has now been in effect for eight years and there have now been
sufficient cases to make determinations on what exactly this rule has
meant in practice. How have complaints turned out? What exactly is
‘excessive’ detail?</p>
<p>There have been forty-six complaints under this clause - most complaints
are brought by relatives of the deceased, with a small number being
triggered by suicide prevention organisations&nbsp;or elected officials. In
one case the PCC itself brought the complaint against
fourteen&nbsp;newspapers over the same story.</p>
<p>Many complaints are resolved with an apology or a voluntary redaction of
their online archive by the newspaper - but in some cases the PCCs
reasoning over what level of detail is or isn’t ‘excessive’ becomes
clearer. Examining all rulings involving 5.ii, I found that the PCC to
date have chosen to interpret it as a rule against popularizing or
explaining unusual or technical methods of suicide. Details tend to be
allowed when the method can in some sense be seen as ‘obvious’. To use
specific cases, it is wrong to tell people how many pills are a fatal
dose or how a suicide involving a balloon kit was accomplished but it is
acceptable to describe someone as having hung themselves with their
shoelaces.</p>
<p>In the case of hanging (a minority of PCC complaints but the most common
method of suicide in the UK), the PCC has repeated argued the material
used to perform the act does not constitute part of the method. In the
very first complaint under 5.ii it was argued
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==</a>] that the
inclusion of a “photograph taken from the centre’s CCTV footage of [a
man] walking towards a stairwell with a bed sheet tied around his neck”
was not excessive as the rule was ‘designed to prevent the inclusion of
detail in newspaper reports that might provoke ‘copycat’ suicides. The
inclusion of a photograph of the complainant’s father before his death
did not raise an issue under this part of the Code.’ Similarly, in 2011
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==</a>] a complaint
that about including the fact that someone had hung ‘himself with
shoelaces’ was included in the headline was rejected, arguing that “the
article had only referred to the material with which the complainant had
hanged himself. The Commission found that the reference under complaint
did not represent an excessive detail such that would represent a breach
of the Code.”.</p>
<p>The PCC also rejected a complaint in 2008 that inclusion of a picture of
a noose in a story about suicides in Bridgend was an excessive amount of
detail - “It had to have regard to the fact that – regrettably – there
had been a spate of deaths by hanging, and that this fact was
well-known. The picture of the noose did not make public anything new
about the deaths, or describe the actual process by which individuals
had used particular materials to take their own lives.”</p>
<p>This approach is a problem because contrary to the idea that everybody
already knows how to hang themselves, information about exact hanging
techniques varies and even minor details can change how attractive the
idea of hanging is to a person. Biddle et al. [1] conducted a study with
people who had attempted suicide explicitly aimed at finding out why
they did or didn’t choose hanging as a method. People who tried hanging
believed it would be quick, easy and could be done with materials to
hand. People who did not believed it would be slow, painful or that they
lacked the technical know-how or rope to make the noose. This last point
is especially important, for hanging object is method - this is
information that change the desirability of the method. The PCC fixation
on technical or pharmaceutical suicides misses the purpose of the rule -
the concealment of unnecessary elements that might change the likelihood
someone puts into practice a given method.</p>
<p>As shown earlier [in not published sections], method and suicidal intent
is highly interlinked - restricting methods (either through physical
restrictions or by creating ignorance) is the most effective way of
having an effect on suicide across a society. This is the area where the
scientific evidence is most certain and if journalists can be convinced
of this solitary point it would account for most of the effect any wider
restrictions would give. The PCC (or its successor body) needs to take
into scope ‘obvious’ suicide methods and descriptions that might make
them more salient in the mind of a reader. These are after all the most
common and so an area where efforts would be likely to have the most
impact.</p>
