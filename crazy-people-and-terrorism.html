					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidmichaelshanks/2449510845/"><img alt="Half Mast" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2449510845_85e1c422f3.jpg" /></a>It's inevitable with breaking stories that the media is
going to call some things wrong, what's more concerning is that it tends
to do this in ways that are revealing of deeper problems. Immediately
after the attacks in Norway the commentariat's initial reaction was to
blame it on Islamic terrorism, which is understandable because it is
after all the sexiest kind of terrorism. That the information that the
majority of terrorist attacks in Europe are <a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/25/missing_the_real_warning_signs">committed by home grown
groups</a>
is easily found on the internet is neither here nor there - as Charlie
Brooker <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/24/charlie-brooker-norway-mass-killings">put
it</a>,
the media coverage was less experts than guessers and they &quot;were
terrible, like toddlers hypothesising how a helicopter works.&quot;</p>
<p>The news media is rarely humbled or apologetic when they get things
wrong but simply moves on to being wrong about something else, often in
the same story. The next step here is the assertion with little proof,
that Anders Breivik is insane. It might well turn out that he is, but in
the meantime not only does this reinforce the harmful stereotype
connecting mental health issues with violence, it's also a bit
convenient because irrational people can't be expected to be reacting to
incentives and so it absolves anyone else of responsibility in creating
an environment where he felt that terrorism was a good idea. It's not
clear to me that his actions are inherently irrational, it's very
apparently a politically motivated crime with the express purpose of a)
harming 'the enemy' and b) gaining him and his beliefs exposure. Given
the well-established pattern of how the world's media cover shootings, b
was at least was a slam dunk. The Norwegian court in closing the hearing
was operating under the strange principle that it shouldn't be a
complacent part of a mass murderer's pre-meditated promotion strategy,
something that media outlets have always had much more trouble doing.
His (I'm assuming pre-prepared) image plastered websites and newspapers
for days, the 24 news channels didn't stop for speculation and
examination of his motives, and the attack spurred a series of '<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">He's
obviously an awful person, but he's not
wrong</a>'
articles. It's not the start of the revolution he hoped for but as a
political act, it was far from inconsequential. Dismissing him as simply
a 'maniac' ignores the fact that the reaction of the media to massacres
like these actually acts as a powerful incentive to commit them.</p>
<p>On the other side of the blame game, insanity neatly helps those who
occupy relatively mainstream spaces in society and have spent years fear
mongering about Islam pending takeover of Europe to create a comfortable
distance between themselves and Breivik. I'm going to pick on Tim
Stanley's <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100098575/whatever-liberal-commentators-say-the-tea-party-does-not-bear-responsibility-for-anders-breivik/">Telegraph
post</a>
for being well ahead of the curve on this one. Despite Breivik obvious
political motivations (like, he wrote them down) Stanley insists that
these are the actions of a 'lone psychopath', and that any connection
between his actions and his claimed motivations are entirely
coincidental. His statement that &quot;[t]he kind of person who can
systematically shoot and kill that many people is mentally ill or
possessed by demons&quot; is helpful, because here 'mental illness' is
performing exactly the same role that blaming things on demons does, a
scapegoat that absolves us of responsibility[1. Stanley's attempt to
dismiss his strawman notion that 'the left' thinks 'the right' is
responsible for all anti-Islamic violence by equating it with the
absurdity of the idea that 'the left' must be responsible for all
anti-Christian violence is especially cruel given that many Christians
would consider themselves to be on the left, and just the other year
churchgoers in Tennessee were gunned down by a man with a hatred of
liberals <a class="reference external" href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/knoxville-church-shooters-manifesto">who
name-checked</a>
several of the same people as Breivik. Also despite what he says links
between Tea&nbsp;Party groups and white supremacists are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/pages/tea-party-report">alive and
credible</a>.]. Somehow
these 'lone wolves' get the idea that the world would be a better place
without certain groups and while maybe they're just picking ideas out of
the aether, it is at least slightly possible that they are aided to
these positions by reading the rhetoric of the people they say they're
reading. While with the media platform issue there are at least clear
steps that could be taken to reduce the problem, I'm not exactly sure
what the solution is here. I do think there's some sort of moral duty
incumbent on people not to make their careers spreading xenophobia and
hate, but that's less because people might go out and shoot people and
more because it's a generally shit thing to do. Melanie Phillips'
response to finding two of her articles within his manifesto <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/25/norway-melanie-phillips-hits-back">is
revealing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The supposed beliefs of Norway massacre's perpetrator has got the
left in general wetting itself in delirium at this apparently
heaven-sent opportunity to take down those who fight for life,
liberty and western civilisation against those who would destroy
it.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I have vague sympathy here because Philips isn't actively fermenting
armed revolution but to me safeguarding western civilisation is a cause
that's probably worth killing for. If you're telling people the stakes
are <em>that</em> high, <a class="reference external" href="http://flyingrodent.blogspot.com/2011/07/worlds-first-anti-jihadist-mass.html">can you really claim distance when people take you
seriously</a>?
If having been repeatedly told by authority figures that your cause is
literally the defence of western civilisation, you find yourself unable
to effect the mainstream political process but know that you'll be given
a world-wide platform if you commit a horrific act, why wouldn't it be
rational to put your manifesto on the internet and go kill a bunch of
kids? If the idea of 'killing innocents so more can be saved' is
inherently crazy then there's a lot of foreign policy we need to
revisit, and if killing full stop is a sign of deranged mind it's in
even bigger trouble.</p>
<p>My point here is that you don't have to be crazy to be an extremist and
you don't have to be crazy to kill people, either might be immoral but
by themselves do not suggest anything about someone's sanity. It might
yet turn out that Breivik is insane (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-is-insane-says-his-lawyer-2326232.html">his lawyer thinks he
is</a>,
let's wait for the doctors) but should that happen it doesn't
retrospectively improve the current rhetoric any more than if the attack
had been carried out by al-Qaeda it would have made the initial coverage
any less terrible - it simply means that that particular guess was
correct and it's one rooted in prejudices and self-interest rather than
reality.</p>
