State</a>'
for a class, and it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me his basic frame is something that is
useful for&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;various changes in Facebook.&nbsp;One of his recurring
ideas is that the state as it develops&nbsp;homogenizes various features of
the society to allow the 'center' to better gather&nbsp;information&nbsp;about its
capacities and so more effectively govern and rule. This goes from grid
cities eliminating the need for local knowledge and maps to navigate, to
standardization on language to remove the need for local interpreters,
the creation of fixed last names for the purpose of tax collection and
so on - devices that are designed to undermine the importance of local
knowledge and make the society more legible to outsiders.</p>
<p>To a certain extent we can see&nbsp;Facebook take similar paths as it
develops, the most obvious example being when the open-ended 'About Me'
text fields (for interests, sports, movies, music etc) were converted
into a system of links to pages (for various interest, sports, movies,
music, etc) where a user selects which links they want to connect to
their profile.</p>
<p>The old system was very local, I can look at my friends' pages and see
what their interests are and&nbsp;vice&nbsp;versa, it's a system for people who
know each other to share&nbsp;information&nbsp;with each other. While it works
well for one-on-one human interaction, it has a number of disadvantages
for Facebook's position at the center - to&nbsp;find out if someone has 'X'
as in interest, they have to search their database which is time and
resource consuming as most of their lots of users probably don't mention
'X' at all. In addition to that, what if someone spells it wrong? Or
uses a local label, or a variation on it? In those&nbsp;conditions, there is
an awful lot of&nbsp;information&nbsp;inside Facebook that it effectively has no
idea about, because it doesn't have cheap and&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;ways of accessing
it.</p>
<p>If we imagine Facebook as a series of nodes (people, pages), links
between nodes, and prongs (information associated with a single note) -
it is prongs that cause this difficulty for Facebook. From their
perspective it makes sense to try to convert prongs to links because
links are nicely&nbsp;quantifiable&nbsp;and trackable - it's a much simple matter
to find out how many users have linked to 'X', and also how many are
linked to Y'. &nbsp;But this process was a simplification of the range of
expression&nbsp;available&nbsp;to users, done in the interest of making
the&nbsp;information&nbsp;present within&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;more legible to the center. Most
tellingly, similar&nbsp;to how this development in the state is associated
with improved tax collection, better knowledge of its users makes their
knowledge base more valuable to outsiders, who pay Facebook for access
to it. Making people legible is a way of converting them into money.</p>
<p>On a bit of a side-note from that, Facebook often claims that
all&nbsp;information&nbsp;shared with it is entirely&nbsp;voluntary&nbsp;but something you
see sometimes is them attempting to&nbsp;manipulate&nbsp;people to share
certain&nbsp;information&nbsp;through UI design. In one of the re-designs last
year, the&nbsp;employment&nbsp;and education fields jumped out of being hidden on
a back page to being the first thing underneath your name, one of the
most important places on the screen and something you'd be prompted to
fill in everytime you visited your own page. &nbsp;I suspect this is a result
of their decision to switch away from networks as a means of
organisation and privacy control - networks were also a source
of&nbsp;information, if you're in the Durham network you're highly likely to
be a current or recent Durham student (and there were briefly corporate
networks for catching graduates and the general public). By removing the
importance of networks, there's no incentive for people to join networks
and share that&nbsp;information&nbsp;about their education or employment, hence
the quality of their&nbsp;information&nbsp;degraded and they needed to encourage
more people to give them back the&nbsp;information&nbsp;they'd lost through these
other means. Now of course, you still choose if you fill it in or not -
but I bet a lot more people did than who would have otherwise, Facebook
isn't neutral or passive about which&nbsp;information&nbsp;it wants.</p>
