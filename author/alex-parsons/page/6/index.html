					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Sergebac7thcentury-150x150.jpg" />The Church of England's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1475149/s-s%20marriage.pdf">response</a>&nbsp;to
the consultation&nbsp;on same-sex marriage caused some waves this week.&nbsp;Given
the debates inside the church on homosexuality that the response isn't a
heartful endorsement isn't a huge surprise, but it's always a little bit
disappointing to be reminded that an organisation still so entwined with
the state holds these views.</p>
<p>It's well worth a read though, even if you find their arguments
unconvincing it's filled with interesting facts - did you know that you
have a right to be wed in your parish church and the vicar has to
perform it, regardless of your religious affiliation (or lack thereof)?
'The church will be forced to marry people!' has been out of the bag for
a while apparently.</p>
<p>I found a few sections in particular worth pulling out.&nbsp;The response
opens claiming that that the church has actually been pretty progressive
on same-sex couples in general but marriage is something that needs
special consideration:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;We have supported various legal changes in recent years to remove
unjustified discrimination and create greater legal rights for same
sex couples and we welcome that fact that previous legal and
material inequities between heterosexual and same-sex partnerships
have now been satisfactorily addressed.</blockquote>
<p>As has been pointed out a few times, this is a pretty generous
interpretion of the Church's history on the matter. Their contribution
to the Civil Partnership Bill in 2004 was notable for six bishops trying
to help <a class="reference external" href="http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/history-written-and-rewritten/">sink
it</a>
with a wrecking&nbsp;amendment, it's&nbsp;only fourteen years since the highest
figures in the church argued that gay people between 16 and 18 having
sex should <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/116865.stm">remain
criminalized</a>&nbsp;because
dropping the age of consent would send a 'wrong message', and in 2006
they <a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6293115.stm">boldly stood up</a> for
the rights of the Catholic Church to have more opt-outs allowing
discrimination against same-sex couples.&nbsp;The Anglican community is
hardly <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2012/jun/12/church-of-england-gay-marriage">all on the same side on
this</a>,
but the direction the church has chosen to use its power is a little
revealing.</p>
<p>Next up is the claim that that marriage as currently stands is a
timeless institution that's existed pretty much forever - trying to put
it that arguing&nbsp;against one-man-one-woman marriage is like arguing
against gravity - it's just a fact, that's what&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In common with almost all other Churches, the Church of England
holds, as a matter of doctrine and derived from the teaching of
Christ himself, that marriage in general – and not just the marriage
of Christians – is, in its nature, a lifelong union of <strong>one man
with one woman</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Such a move would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the
union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>throughout history</strong>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Throughout <strong>history</strong>, in the laws of the land and in the Church of
England‘s Book of Common Prayer on which the laws concerning
marriage are grounded, marriage has been <strong>understood to be, always
and exclusively, between a woman and a man.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The intrinsic nature of marriage, as enshrined in human institutions
<strong>since before the advent of either church or state</strong>, is the union
of a man and a woman.</p>
<p>Marriage affords many benefits to society, which include
<strong>mutuality</strong>, fidelity and &nbsp;biological complementarity with the
possibility of procreation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another case where there's quite a substantial clash with
reality. Quite a few cultures have accepted definitions of marriage
outside of this, same-sex&nbsp;marriage has existed in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions">various forms at
various
times</a>, and
polygamous&nbsp;cultures are&nbsp;hardly rare - awkwardly several of them
documented this fact in their holy books and as a result there are
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_bibl0.htm">eight kinds of
marriage</a> sanctioned
in the Bible. While none of them are same sex as such, many differ from
the &quot;lifelong union of&nbsp;one man with one woman&quot; as has existed &quot;before
the advent of either church or state&quot;.</p>
<p>Mentioning 'mutuality' is an interesting point, because that's one
aspect of marriage that even within the Church's (relatively short)
history hasn't been constant. &nbsp;On page 2 they cite a definition
of&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts.aspx">Common
Worship</a>&nbsp;which
draws heavily on the marriage vows:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The Church of Christ understands marriage to be, in the will of
God, the union of a man and a woman, for better, for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,&nbsp;to love and to
cherish, till parted by death.&quot; (Common Worship: Pastoral Services,
page 177)</blockquote>
<p>But if we go back to<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-of-solemnization-of-matrimony.aspx">the Book of Common
Prayer</a>&nbsp;cited
above&nbsp;we quickly find a departure from this&nbsp;mutuality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long
as ye both shall live?</p>
<p>The Man shall answer,</p>
<p>I will.</p>
<p>Then shall the Priest say unto the Woman,</p>
<p>N.&nbsp;WILT&nbsp;thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
<strong>obey him, and serve him</strong>, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness
and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so
long as ye both shall live?</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Woman shall answer,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I will.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/marriage.aspx">revised Common
Worship</a>
this has been ironed out and 'obey' banished to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/alternativetexts.aspx#vows">alternative
vows</a>&nbsp;(where
'serve' is nowhere to be found not technically being part of the vows in
the original). Now this shift isn't that&nbsp;obscure&nbsp;or hidden knowledge,
but that the mutual character of marriage is a somewhat modern
institution is something that the church should remember. They haven't
been protecting a perfectly Christian conception of marriage while the
rest of society muddled and changed it's definitions - they've been
right here with us as marriage evolved into what it is today.</p>
<p>This next one is my favourite:</p>
<blockquote>
To argue that this is of no social value is to assert that men and
women are simply interchangeable individuals. It also undermines
many of the arguments which <strong>support the deeper involvement of
women in all social institutions</strong> on the grounds that a society
cannot flourish without the specific and distinctive contributions
of each gender.</blockquote>
<p>This is a beautiful argument that same-sex marriage undermines arguments
against sexism. After all, if we need women in every boardroom don't we
need them in every&nbsp;marriage?&nbsp;This is of course all the less convincing
coming from an organisation that is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18157584">at this very
moment</a> fudging the entry of
women into its corridors of power.</p>
<p>To round it off the annex plays some interesting games with definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only kind of marriage which English law recognises is one which
is&nbsp;essentially <strong>the voluntary union for life of one man with one
woman to the exclusion of all others.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>That institution would be one which was defined <strong>as the voluntary
union for life of any two persons</strong>. English law would, as a result,
cease to provide or recognise an institution that represented the
traditional understanding of marriage as the voluntary union for
life of one man with one woman</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>the established institution of marriage, as currently defined and
recognised in English law, would in effect, have been abolished and
replaced <strong>by a new statutory concept which the Church – and many
outside the Church – would struggle to recognise as amounting to
marriage at all. A man and a woman who wished to enter into the
traditional institution of marriage would no longer have the
opportunity to do so.</strong> Only the new, statutory institution, which
defined a &nbsp;marriage‘ as the voluntary union of any two persons,
would be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see, in the past marriage was between 'a man and a woman' now it'll
be between 'two persons' - this will totally ruin it for all those
couples that are made up of a man and woman but contain no persons!</p>
<p>It's hard to pin down why but I find this is one of the most
distasteful&nbsp;arguments in the whole thing. &nbsp;What they're implying here is
that there's&nbsp;harm in some way being done to heterosexual married couples
-&nbsp;that the marriage they had no longer existed, its gone, erased with a
pen-stroke, replaced by a ghoul that wears its face but isn't the same
at all. It crosses the line from inventing history to inventing harm,
and there's something ugly in that.</p>

					<p>I've been listening to lots of interesting comments on the
Independence&nbsp;Referendum&nbsp;debate recently&nbsp;and thought it was probably
worth getting all my notes somewhere in a coherent form.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;shied&nbsp;away
from developments on the substance of independence or devolution towards
issues relating the process and form of the referendum itself (and the
post is large enough just focusing on those questions). The following is
based on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">an&nbsp;event at the Constitution
Unit</a>&nbsp;with
<a class="reference external" href="http://constitution-unit.com/2012/03/12/scottish-independence-referendum-should-be-lawful-fair-and-decisive/">Prof. Robert
Hazell</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan Trench</a>&nbsp;and two
panels before the Scottish Affairs Committee, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10452">one quizzing
academics</a>
(for the purposes of this post, Panel A) and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">the other quizzing both
sides of the AV
campaign</a>
(Panel B).</p>
<p><em>Panel A:</em></p>
<div><p>Professor Vernon Bogdanor, Research Professor at King’s College London</p>
</div><div><div><p>Professor John Curtice, Professor of Politics University of Strathclyde</p>
</div><div><p>Peter Kellner, President, YouGov</p>
</div></div><div><p>Professor Iain McLean, Official Fellow in Politics, Nuffield College,
University of Oxford</p>
</div><p><em>Panel B:</em></p>
<div><p>Matthew Elliott&nbsp;- Campaign Director of NOTOAV</p>
</div><div><p>Katie Ghose - Chair of Yes To Fairer Votes, Chief Executive of Electoral
Reform Society (ERS)</p>
</div><div><p>William&nbsp;Norton -&nbsp;Responsible Person for NOTOAV&nbsp;and referendum agent for
No campaign for NE Referendum 2004</p>
<p>Willie Sullivan - Head of Field Operations for yes to fairer votes,&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;director of Electoral Reform Society (ERS).</p>
</div><p>I've also included some brief comments from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=9307">the Electoral Commission
evidence</a>,
but for the most part the debate has changed enough to make much of that
session irrelevant.</p>
<div class="section" id="role-of-the-electoral-commission">
<h2><strong>Role of the Electoral Commission</strong></h2>
<p>The general consensus from Panels A &amp; B that the currently proposed
question is unfair, but Curtice points out that Electoral Commission
corrections haven't always been completely&nbsp;unobjectionable&nbsp;so wouldn't
go as far as to make the commission's comments on questions binding.
Along those lines&nbsp;Norton argued it'd be unnecessary as proceeding with
a&nbsp;question&nbsp;the Electoral Commission had labelled dodgy would be a gift
to the&nbsp;disadvantaged&nbsp;campaign anyway so sufficient political incentives
exist without mandating use of the electoral commission formulation.
&nbsp;Kellner made the case that the question doesn't actually make that much
difference, something interesting for a pollster to say as question
effects can have a large effect on how people answer. &nbsp;However I can see
there being a case for not applying polling logic to referenda as most
voters will be exposed to the campaigns long before the ballot and so
question-wording effects could be far less strong than in polling. &nbsp;He
argued what was far more important was that the question be&nbsp;perceived&nbsp;to
be fair, and the Electoral Commission role in this regard
is&nbsp;creating&nbsp;demonstrable&nbsp;justice rather than creating an unproblematic
question.</p>
<p>There was a general feeling in panel A however that in the event of
referendum where there might be other&nbsp;contentious&nbsp;structural issues
other than the question (such as the form of questions and counting
system to choose between three or more options) that the commission's
advisory role should be expanded to include those issues.&nbsp;In Panel B
there was opposition&nbsp;to the idea of the electoral commission producing
more material, with both sides pointing out they objected to the neutral
material during the AV campaign. Sullivan argued that it probably wasn't
cost-effective and the money might be better spent on more broadcasts -
which Elliot argued there should be more of, but shorter to fit in
better with how people understand adverts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-a-yes-no-format-matter">
<h2><strong>Does a 'yes/no' format matter?</strong></h2>
<p>The former Scottish First Minister Lord McConnell has suggested <a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9141435/Lord-McConnell-Hold-referendum-on-straight-question-within-18-months.html">that
votes should select from
duelling&nbsp;statements</a>&nbsp;(i.e.
something like 'Scotland should be an independent country'', 'Scotland
should remain part of the UK'') rather than answering a yes/no question
to&nbsp;deprive the SNP of the advantage of running a 'yes' campaign, but
from the AV teams there wasn't an impression that this was hugely
important.&nbsp;Elliot argued that actually yes/no isn't hugely important (or
at least that slanting is variable on economic conditions and national
mood rather than an inherent bias either way) and the debate can still
be defined in those terms even if the question isn't, with the example
of how the 1997 Scottish referendum was covered by the media as a yes/no
campaign despite it a question of&nbsp;duelling&nbsp;statements. Sullivan thought
that the big difference was 'change/status quo' which exists however the
question is worded, and that the advantage will rest with&nbsp;the&nbsp;status
quo. The take away message here being that there probably isn't a lot of
point in trying to avoid a 'yes/no' question.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-there-be-multiple-options">
<h2><strong>Should there be multiple options?</strong></h2>
<p>Kellner said it would be 'perverse' if some kind of devo-max wasn't an
option and as Bogdanor&nbsp;nicely put it &quot;it'd be very odd that an
instrument designed to discover what Scottish people think
should&nbsp;exclude&nbsp;the option that they most favour&quot;.&nbsp;Trench argued that
most Scots want around 65% change which is closer to independence than
not, so it could well in the unionist's interests to put forward a
devolution option and that the current Unionist pursuit of a 'jam
tomorrow' option where a No vote on&nbsp;independence&nbsp;would be rewarded with
further devolution could well run into a credibility problem&nbsp;as the
recommendations of Calman Commission have yet to pass into law - giving
a bad record for the UK government's ability to proactively manage
further devolution.</p>
<p>There's a related point that even if there's only one question on the
ballot, there's still a decent case to be made for having multiple
referendums on that single question.&nbsp;As it was unlikely
that&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;or consensus on indepedence or even agreement on
certain flavours of devolution could be reached before the vote
(although Kellner pointed out, a lot of it will become apparent within
the&nbsp;campaign)&nbsp;Panel A were quite keen on the need for two referendums,
one enabling&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;and another post-negotiations&nbsp;binding
referendum for agreement to terms and Trench <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scotland-may-need-two-referendums-and-process-is-flawed-expert-claims-1-2179480">similarly supports
this</a>.
In Panel B, Sullivan indicated that the ERS wasn't&nbsp;wholly supportive of
that (or at least, much less than their evidence would suggest).</p>
<p>Panel A raised concerns about the content of Devo-Max, mainly that it's
as yet ill-defined and needs to be more so before the referendum&nbsp;(the
arrival of devo-plus on the scene may or may not change this situation).
Bogdanor put forward that if it's an option it not only needs to be
defined but needs to be shown what is on offer is&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;an option
from Westminster. Noton pointed out that the North-East devolution,
welsh powers and AV referendums had outcomes that were well-known and
thought out before the election. He argues that it's fundamentally a
unionist proposal and it's up to the unionist side to define it (which
raises the question of who's actually for the status quo, but we'll get
to that in a bit). &nbsp;McLean again argued that it isn't realistic for all
the negotiations to happen ahead of time, hence the idea of a second
confirming referendum.</p>
<p>Ghose and Sullivan agreed that a three option referendum could probably
have three campaigns, which brings up the issue that the&nbsp;Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 &nbsp;(PPERA) has an&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">'all or
nothing'
rule</a>&nbsp;for
having a&nbsp;designated&nbsp;lead campaign, something that could be interesting
in a three-way referendum as it's not at all clear who the groups that
would argue for each option would be - you'd expect a common unionist
position to emerge and it's not clear if that would be devo-max or the
status quo. Depending on the exact details of a devolution option, there
might of course be a three-way split but in the event that this doesn't
happen it's not clear if any lead campaigns are allowed (Referendum

<div class="section" id="how-should-a-multi-question-referendum-be-conducted">
<h2><strong>How should a multi-question referendum be conducted?</strong></h2>
<p>In&nbsp;terms&nbsp;of precedent, the New Zealand electoral system&nbsp;referendum&nbsp;was
mentioned by Kelner, Sullivan and Hazell as an example of how a
multi-option referedum might be conducted.&nbsp;This is is one sense good
precedent being a multi-option referendum from a&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;style
parliamentary democracy, but as it's the&nbsp;example&nbsp;that comes up again and
again it does illustrate that this is relatively new ground and the door
is open for pretty much anything to happen here and
create&nbsp;precedent.&nbsp;Kellner also pointed out the 1997 Scottish devolution
referendum was effectively a three option vote, so it's not completely
without UK&nbsp;precedent, although in this case all three camps would
stronger options. Similarly Norton brought up the North East 2004
referendum as an example but also pointed out as the second question was
a&nbsp;subsidiary&nbsp;question, all campaigning focused on the first question.</p>
<p>The SNP's double question (the problems with which I went into
<a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">here</a>)
seems to have mostly gone away at this point and Panel A were divided on
the best way to go foward. Kellner has previously written something
helpful about the <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">five possible ways of doing
this</a>and
he and McLean both favoured a ballot that allowed people to rank '1' and
'2' which is then counted by the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
method</a>. In the
unlikely event of a Condorcet loop, McLean would want something in the
referendum legislation to deal with it and suggests defaulting to the
status quo. Bogdanor&nbsp;suggested a three option ballot with a later
run-off election and Curtice a gateway question approach, with the first
question giving a choice for&nbsp;independence and if that fails, question
two giving the choice between status quo and devo max.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERS favours
a different gateway question, with the first being a question about
change in principle, the second then being a choice between the two
change options.</p>
<p>As Alan Reid called Sullivan on, the problem with the ERS question is it
only allows the status quo to a voter's first or last preference and
'Devo Max, status quo, independence' is a perfectly likely ordering (and
such a voter could end up empowering their least favoured option by
voting in accordance with their most) - a similar problem holds for
Curtice (it's the flaw of the gateway question in&nbsp;principle) but in this
case it's&nbsp;independence&nbsp;that can only be placed first or last, something
that's possibly more in key with actual preferences.&nbsp;McLean and Kellner
were opposed to runoffs and AV on the grounds that&nbsp;an option like Devo
Max could be the Condorcet winner and the consensus choice but if it
came third in the first round it'd be removed.&nbsp;Panel B very briefly
ventured onto this territory giving us the memorable moment of a former
member of the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign&nbsp;saying &nbsp;'it wouldn't work'
but alas they didn't go further into it.&nbsp;Trench questioned if you could
get a mandate from&nbsp;preferential&nbsp;voting, but this would presumably be
less of an issue with a run-off referendum.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="election-timing">
<h2><strong>Election Timing</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor argues that the referendum should happen sooner rather than
later as the issues aren't that complicated and the continued
uncertainty could be causing economic damage (a point he'd repeat from
the audience at the Con Unit). McLean argued in response that the
biggest economic issue is currency for&nbsp;Scotland's&nbsp;large financial
industry - and that this is an issue that could be addressed (and there
is incentive for both sides to do so) well before the referendum, making
timing less of an issue.</p>
<p>Hazell disagreed with Bogdanor that economic grounds were enough to
justify Westminster interference in picking a date, and argued
that&nbsp;there are two legitimate concerns for the UK&nbsp;government&nbsp;regarding
the time - avoiding a day that clashes with another election, and also
one that would come close to the next general election as this would
create <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/scottish-referendum-date-matters?">constitutional
awkwardness</a>
in the event of a vote for independence if a general
election&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;between the yes vote and independence - Scottish MPs
would be returned and potentially help form a&nbsp;government&nbsp;before
disappearing again.</p>
<p>This suggests that a date should be picked with regard to being able to
wrap up potential&nbsp;negotiations&nbsp;before May 2015 - however the assumption
here is that the fixed parliament will last that long &nbsp;-&nbsp;over at the LSE
Politics and Policy blog Patrick Dunleavy is <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2012/02/20/general-election-2014-dunleavy/">not at all
convinced</a>
that the coalition will go the distance, expecting a dissolution and
Conservative and Labour agreement on an early election sometime in 2014
- in which case it's probably too late to avoid the problem above.
However this exact question and an ongoing referendum through 2014 might
actually either reinforce the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;or at least
create&nbsp;disincentives&nbsp;for Labour to agree to dissolve&nbsp;parliament (Keeping
Scotland in the union is strongly in the party's interest and may
deplete campaigning funds to an extent that they don't want to run a
general election the same year) and&nbsp;hence make the&nbsp;coalition&nbsp;more likely
to run it's full course - so it's possibly everything cancels out here.</p>
<p>On a related time issue is the length of control period and the campaign
in general, which there was a general consensus in panel B that a longer
period was better and that the campaign needed at least twelve months.
&nbsp;Norton&nbsp;argued&nbsp;that 10 weeks control period simply wasn't enough time to
deal with the&nbsp;practicalities and time taken along the critical path to
the free post mailshots - in 2004 his campaign almost missed the
deadline and the NotoAV campaign this time around started printing
before they were&nbsp;officially&nbsp;the&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaign.&nbsp;The main problem
(that's probably&nbsp;unresolvable) with referenda as opposed
to&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament&nbsp;elections (and now&nbsp;possibly Westminster) is
there's no fixed time for the election to work towards and there’s an
incentive to do what the SNP are doing and have a long pre-legislation
period (still &nbsp;a year to go before that according to their timetable)
where campaign actions can’t be monitored because
there’s&nbsp;officially&nbsp;nothing to campaign about going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="franchise">
<h2><strong>Franchise</strong></h2>
<p>Bogdanor thinks the voting age should be 16, but
that&nbsp;referenda&nbsp;shouldn't be special and the existing&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;should
apply. Curtice argues that changing the francise would be opening a can
of worms in terms of ideas about nationality and that&nbsp;&nbsp;it'd be
technically difficult to get people on the register anyway. Andrew
Scallan (Director of Electoral Administration at The Electoral
Commission)&nbsp;spent a long time not wanting to give a precise answer as to
how long the process of expanding the registers would take (more than
week, less than a year) but did suggest the best scenario would be
legislation in the summer followed by a household canvas in the
Autumn,&nbsp;but&nbsp;at other times of year the process might be more
difficult/result in a less complete register.</p>
<p>Interestingly as it's a local government francise EU citizens would be
able to vote but as typically they're bared from national elections
(which elections for a&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;parliament would become in the event of
an independence win) means that they could effectively vote to remove
their own representation. Curtice points out however that they're
unlikely to vote at all so it's a bit of a moot point.</p>

<p>The role of the rest of the UK in this decision is&nbsp;variable&nbsp;on outcome,
Mclean argues that Scotland could declare independence&nbsp;unilateral&nbsp;but
could not declare devo max&nbsp;unilateral, as devolution would be a gift of
powers from Westminster. This distinction is less than it seems though
as the kind of independence that the SNP describes includes some quite
complex inter-dependence that would similarly require UK consent.&nbsp;Trench
said that a referendum on devo-max could include the rest of the UK &nbsp;(I
think I'd be correct in describing his view as falling far shorter than
'should'), Hazell was content that it could be negotiated by the
government. If the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;in general has been for referendums to
devolve powers, the&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;is also that only the affected region

<p>During the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523">AV Campaigns
evidence</a>
for the Scottish Affairs Committee, David Mowat (Conservative
MP)&nbsp;brought up in passing the idea that devo-max could involve an
element of reduction of&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;seats in&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;in exchange for
powers, an idea that's appearing in a few places (just a few examples,
this&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ditchley.co.uk/page/384/annual-lecture-xlvii.htm">speech</a>&nbsp;by
John Major and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">this
article</a>
in the&nbsp;Scotsman) and I thought it was worth branching off this
discussion into a new post.</p>
<p>At one level the position is understandable,&nbsp;reducing seats was how
historically devolution used to work with a reduction in Irish seats
when home rule was introduced in 1921.&nbsp;The idea that seat allocation was
related to national status received more&nbsp;systematic&nbsp;backing at the 1944
Speaker's Convention where the principle was agreed that there was a
case for &quot;substantial representation&quot; of a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;nation beyond what
mathematical divisions would provide.</p>
<p>However now the principle of electoral equality has completely swept
this approach away.</p>
<p>To trace the most&nbsp;official&nbsp;examples, the idea of reducing Scottish and
Welsh seats pops up several times in the Justice Committee
Report&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmjust/529/529i.pdf">&quot;Devolution: A Decade
On&quot;</a>&nbsp;and
the most precise formulation is cited from a Constitution Unit Report by
Robert Hazell: &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/publications/tabs/unit-publications/141.pdf">Towards a New Constitutional Settlement: An Agenda for
Gordon Brown’s First 100 Days and
Beyond</a>&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One partial solution Gordon Brown could consider is to harmonise the
electoral quotas of the four UK territories, ending English
under-representation, or even to reduce the representation of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to two-thirds that of
England*.</p>
<p>*This solution has historic precedent in that during the operation
of the Northern Ireland Parliament (1922-72) Northern Ireland had 12
MPs, &nbsp;rather than the 18 its population demanded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Justice Committee Report is a little sly in this respect, reframing
this as:</p>
<blockquote>
The latter approach was taken when the 1922 Parliament of Northern
Ireland was created, and Northern Ireland MPs were reduced to
twelve. In 2005 the number of Scottish MPs was reduced from 72 to
59. (pp. 61-62)</blockquote>
<p>The implication being that the 2005 reduction is another example of the
principle at work in the Northern Ireland example when it's actually
just a delayed&nbsp;consequence&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Scotland Act 1998, which I'd argue is
working under quite different principles.</p>
<p>Now in a crude way the Act could be seen as being a 'seats for powers'
transaction as it both create a devolved body and decreases seats (that
link &nbsp;is made pretty explicitly by that piece in
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828">Scotsman</a>),
but the method it uses to do so is significant.</p>
<p>The reduction in seats removes the minimum of 71 seats and a
separate&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;quota, ending over-representation of Scotland - but
the method used more&nbsp;represents a principle of electoral equality
by&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/86">syncing the Scottish&nbsp;electoral&nbsp;quota with the English
quota</a>,
something that was repeated and taken further with<a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/part/2">&nbsp;the creation of a
UK-wide quota</a>&nbsp;by
the&nbsp;Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011.</p>
<p>The trend through these changes has been an effective reduction of seats
in devolved regions (or will be if the current boundary proposals are
ever passed), but the justifying principle in these cases was &quot;one
person, one vote&quot; not &quot;seats for powers&quot;.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;successive&nbsp;change has
been in favour of greater and stricter stress being giving
to&nbsp;mathematical equality on constituency apportionment, so to at this
point give Scotland less representation because of greater devolution
would be a step backwards.</p>
<p>Although there's historical&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;it's worth considering that how we
understand seats and apportionment has undergone&nbsp;enormous&nbsp;shifts since
1921.&nbsp;Today the idea that national representation should be considered
is completely lacking from the law governing apportionment.&nbsp;It's also
not at all clear it resolves the problems it's supposed to address. Is
the West Lothian question really resolved by slightly fewer Scottish MPs
voting on English matters?&nbsp;Similarly, on matters like defence and
foreign affairs, there's no particular reason why Scottish voices should
matter less on the issues they would still return MPs on.</p>
<p>As a compromise to save the union it could be a short-lived one. &nbsp;In
answer to a question on&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence">his
presentation</a>
at the Constitution Unit <a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/">Alan
Trench</a> put forward that
devo-max might be an unstable position as foreign policy can often be a
wedge issue &nbsp;- would this situation be better or worse if Scotland had a
legitimate&nbsp;grievance&nbsp;of unequal representation in crafting that policy
added to it?</p>
<p>But on the practical side assuming an 'English votes on English issues'
rule, Scottish MPs would be left with far less to do (especially if
their ability to sit on committees is restricted) and their non-voting
functions probably could be done by fewer MPs.&nbsp;If so reducing their
number would seem to be a good idea not only to avoid waste, but to
ensure the job is still active enough to attract good candidates. But
how can this be done while still respecting voter equality?</p>
<p>The solution is to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;the idea of an MP's vote from their physical
person.&nbsp;Scottish voters are entitled to have their votes weighed the
same as those in the other nations - but Scottish MPs don't need to have
the same voting power as other MPs. The voting power of Scottish MPs
could be increased to&nbsp;allow both a reduction in numbers and also
preserve&nbsp;mathematical&nbsp;equality (for a reduction of 2/3 this would give
Scottish MPs a vote worth one and a half their current vote, and so on).</p>
<p>Weighted voting isn't a new idea in principle but it's one that's rarely
been used in the UK - I think it's a good one to think more about in
this case as it allows respect for both voter equality and the fact that
more devolution will have practical effects at Westminster.</p>

					<p>While Battlestar Galactica is seen as the sci-fi show that is most
clearly a&nbsp;thematic reaction to 9/11 and the 'post 9/11 world'
(complaints about how its <a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/10/in-which-your-host-gets-angry-and-other.html">ripped from the headlines
nature</a>
negate it's own ability to world-build notwithstanding), something I've
started to noticed is sci-fi shows using the imagery of 9/11 in a
distinctive way quite&nbsp;separated&nbsp;from delving into the events themselves.
&nbsp;One of most famous reveals in cinematic sci-fi is from The Planet of
the Apes, where Charton Heston finds the <a class="reference external" href="http://movieclips.com/Y72BL-planet-of-the-apes-movie-the-statue-of-liberty/">Statue of Liberty buried in
the
beach</a>
and realises this place that he thought was an alien wilderness is in
fact all too familiar. What’s cropping up in a few places now is the
World Trade Center working as the reverse of that, a reveal of a New
York landmark that shows you have left the familiar and entered a
strange, unsettling place.</p>
<p>In both Fringe and the US-remake of Life on Mars, the presence of the
World Trade Center serves this function, solidifying&nbsp;that characters
have entered a strange new world. In Life on Mars, Sam Tyler seeing the
intact WTC is the crown of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9GNi6tSmc">the accident
sequence</a>, finishing his
transition to the alien world of yesterday.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/a/Whqtx#0"><img alt="image0" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/fringeposter-300x82.png" /></a></p>
<p>A major feature of Fringe is the presence of an alternate universe that
is fundamentally <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjEMKVdSVc">both similar and different to our
own</a>. &nbsp;At the end of the
first season of Fringe, Olivia has travelled to meet the enigmatic
William Bell only to whisked away to somewhere else - the final shot of
the series revealing she has travelled to the other universe and to an
office in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_go1SU1oJ0&amp;t=2m00s">a still-standing alternate version of the World Trade
Center</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;While
the difference in the events of 9/11 are far from the only
feature&nbsp;separating&nbsp;the universes (there’s something interesting about
growing numbers of alternate universes with zeppelins but anyway) it’s
used as a continuing touchstone for stories involving the other
universe; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvw2L6BKv6k&amp;feature=related">the repeated use of the NY
skyline</a>,
an architect from ‘Other There’ caught in a fringe event was designing
the New Pentagon, Peter’s visit to a possible future has him arriving at
the base of a completed Freedom Tower, the ‘amber-blue’ Lincoln Lee on
crossing over for the first time&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;think the other universe seems
that different until he gets his first look at the twin towers - showing
him even though the place is superficially familiar it is deeply alien.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths.png"><img alt="image1" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths-300x85.png" /></a></p>
<p>With their shape they invoke another icon of classic sci-fi: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y15NnGZIBuM">the
monolith</a>.&nbsp;When I first
thought about this I dismissed it as&nbsp;a bit of a trite comparison between
two things that happen to be cuboids - but the way they're used is
actually quite similar; they're deployed as a symbol of strangeness
beyond understanding, something that&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;possibly exist and yet
does.</p>
<p>That the past is many ways a different planet is part of the fundamental
conceit of Life on Mars and for all the discussion of whether 9/11
really did &quot;change everything&quot;, it's interesting to see how quickly it's
entered&nbsp;the sci-fi repertoire as&nbsp;part of how we describe
an&nbsp;utterly&nbsp;alien world.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motti82/3599285646/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2477/3599285646_c4c8534cef.jpg" /></a>One thing that's not being appreciated enough (because it's
only exciting to a certain kind of wonk) is how the debates about a
Scottish Independence referendum are systematically going through every
disputed concept in the idea of elections. When is the vote? About what?
How will they vote? Especially disputed is the question of who should
vote: All affected interests? By geography? By blood? And now there's
also the question of if people younger than 18 should be given a say in
their national future. If this goes anywhere, it would be the first UK
referendum which expands rather than contracts the electorate (and would
require the development of a separate voting register for this election
which might be interesting).</p>
<p>The one thing still off-limit is breaking the idea that all voters
should count equally - a rule I'll argue further down that breaking
would actually provide quite a neat solution to the problem of lowering
the voting age - but first let's go into the normal arguments for a bit.
Here we have Angela Constance <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/2012/02/01/should-16-and-17-year-olds-vote-in-the-referendum/">making the case
for</a>
letting 16 -and 17-year-olds vote:</p>
<blockquote>
After all, if a 16 year old in Scotland can join the army, get
married and pay taxes – surely he or she should be able to have a
say in this country’s future? That is why in the consultation Your
Scotland, Your Referendum, we are seeking views on extending the
right to vote in this referendum to 16 and 17 year olds who are
eligible to be included on the electoral register.</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual trio brought up to demonstrate the unfairness of the
current voting age. The object here is to show that we are in some way
being inconsistent in handling the maturity of 16 year olds without
relying on the slippery slope of 'maturity'. In Scotland the marriage
thing holds (In England and Wales there's a parental consent requirement
below 18) but the army item has gotten more tenuous as although 16 year
olds can join the army <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defencemanagement.com/feature_story.asp?id=15592">they're not actually allowed to deploy anywhere
till they're
18</a>.</p>
<p>The tax argument is worth going into. The idea that there's a connection
between taxation and representation is an old one but not necessarily a
particularly good one to demonstrate inconsistency - being consistent on
it would require us to do far more than allow 16-year-olds to vote. For
a start, we actually let children pay taxes far earlier than 16, any
time a child saves up and buys anything with VAT they're tax-payers.
True at 16 someone can work full time and pay income tax, but there's no
real reason to connect this kind of tax to the franchise and no other.
From the other end we don't take away the right to vote from adult
unemployed people or those in full-time education who similarly have the
potential to be tax-payers but aren't. To be consistent, if it's the
ability to pay tax that's important we must enfranchise anyone who can
earn and spend anything, or if we are treating income tax as a special
case then we need to disenfranchise anyone who is not paying income tax
(in which case the Lib Dem policy of raising the personal threshold
wouldn't be a way of relieving the tax burden on the poorest but a
sneaky way of disenfranchising them).</p>
<p>What this argument is basically getting at is the idea that we have a
norm for granting a set of rights at 16 and voting rights should be
included in it. This is a helpful argument for advocates of lowering the
voting age because it allows an appeal to precedent and doesn't rely
directly on the nebulous idea of 'maturity' - a problematic idea because
there's inevitably only a small difference between each age cohort
making it hard to draw the process to a stop (if we let 18 year olds,
why not 17? And if them why not 16? And if them, why not... and so on).</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that it's hard to see why this logic doesn't
also apply to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/kccentral/yourvoice/yourrights/yourrightsat18.aspx">any other
right</a>
gained at 18. The basic challenge of 'we grant right X at 16, how is it
just that we grant right Y at 18?' applies to all of them. If children
are considered mature enough to have opinions on keeping Trident, why
shouldn't they be allowed to buy fireworks? Taken to its conclusion this
is saying is that adulthood begins at 16, not that children should vote.</p>
<p>There's not necessarily anything wrong with this idea, a society based
on this would be different but not unthinkable, but accepting this puts
an end to the idea of graduated maturity. <a class="reference external" href="http://ann.sagepub.com/content/633/1/141">Andrew Rehfeld
argues</a> that the defining
feature of childhood maturity isn't that it is or isn't present but that
it is 'in development' and I think this chimes with how many people
instinctively feel about the subject. Many 16 year olds are on average
probably mature enough to be citizens, but 18 year olds are on average
more so and 14-year-olds on average less so - hence a structure that
grants legal rights at intervals and removes qualifications on rights as
a person ages seems to fit nicely into this. So given this, how should
voting rights be handled? Highest bundle? Lowest? Rehfeld leans on the
idea of California state senator John Vasconcellos, who argued that
rather than debate at which point we turn on voting rights, we should do
it gradually and give fractional votes to citizens under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Rehfeld actually goes far further than most child voting supporters, not
simply arguing that 16-year-olds should have half a vote until they turn
18, but that we should go far lower and each year from 12 a person
should gain 1/7 of a vote until they have their full vote at 18
(Vasconcellos's fractions were <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Wheels_for_Citizenship">different but same basic
idea</a>).
The basic idea of gradualism I think is a good one because it sidesteps
the problem of a 'race to the bottom' above as this approach reflects
differences in maturity rather than similarities.&nbsp;Practically the vote
count would be different but not&nbsp;unmanageable&nbsp;and could still be done
with a hand count - at it's most basic you could use&nbsp;separate&nbsp;registers
for each birth year, colour-code the voting slips and then count these
votes&nbsp;separate&nbsp;from the main piles. Counting the different cohorts in
series would add little difficulty over simply increasing the number of
voters.</p>
<p>Now that some people should have greater voting power than others is a
commonly-had and commonly-rejected idea. Ultimately that each person has
one vote is a compromise, as any other scheme arguing that certain
citizens are wiser and so should have greater voting powers would not be
generally accepted and so would undermine rather than enrich the
democratic process. I think children are a special case in this sense as
the fractional vote represents a process rather than permanent division.
It's not an argument that a certain race or gender's votes are worth
less, or that any particular&nbsp;qualification&nbsp;should give more voting power
- simply that children start off immature and progress towards maturity
and they should have a voting power that reflects this reality.&nbsp;It
allows for what I think is a reasonably common sense view on the
maturity of children to be expressed, while at the same time recognizing
that children represent real interests (that are distinct from any other
group) and should have a say in matters.</p>
<p>Even as a reduced voting block this would still introduce
a&nbsp;sizeable&nbsp;number of people to the electorate so the result is far from
a token vote, and as a result children would grow and be socialized into
citizenship rather than having it thrust on them all at once. This is a
more radical approach than votes at 16, but I think it ultimately
accomplishes the same aims better and - rather than creating a new
voting age with the same justifications waiting in the wings to lower it
again - would create a future-proof framework for dealing with child
voters. Best case, this gives us a political system more tuned to the
needs and concerns of the young (and by proxy, future generations) and
more children who enter adulthood as politically aware individuals.
Worst case, we add a few more voters to the large number who already
have no idea what they're doing. &nbsp;On the basis of that highly slanted
weighing up of the facts, it'd be silly not to think about it.</p>

				Feb 03, 2012
                
				
					<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EYhVwPqCQ">this video</a>
emerged on the Internet of Boris Johnson being chased outside City Hall
by a man in a chicken suit:</p>
<p>As it turns out this chicken isn't even chasing the actual Boris, giving
us a man wearing a chicken suit chasing a man dressed a man with a fake
blonde wig, being&nbsp;filmed with a shaky camera for authenticity. It's a
strange world we live in, but stranger still is that following
politicians while wearing chicken-suits has a long and proud&nbsp;history.
&nbsp;As far as I can tell, it started in America when Gerald Ford <a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/120064/tales-of-a-serial-prankster-interviewing-the-president-while-wearing-a-chicken-suit/">addressed
the chicken
mascot</a>
of a local radio station while on campaign - a New York Times reporter
then promptly bought the costume off the station and showed up to a
press event in it as a prank (<a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/22347153">video
here</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/chicken-300x173.png:target:/uploads/chicken.png" /></p>
<p>The chicken then went dormant for a while, reappearing in 1992 <a class="reference external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5NGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4586,977613">working
for
Clinton</a>&nbsp;(great
illustration in that article) as 'Chicken George', but this time around
the chicken had a political objective. The job of this chicken was hound
George H. W. Bush for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/news/01iht-deba.html">stonewalling debate
negotiations</a>&nbsp;and
this has been a recurring use of chicken suits since. This version of
the chicken I'm assuming is the inspiration for events in&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/sixth/615fredonia.html">season six
of the West
Wing</a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;Josh
Lyman similarly deploys&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;in chicken suits to hound opponents
who wouldn't debate his candidate.</p>
<p>The Chicken crossed the Atlantic for the 1997 election, giving us the
'Tory Chicken', who followed Tony Blair to highlight that he had
declined to debate John Major. For some reason this triggered a
previously unknown British capacity for animal-suit politics, spawning a
fox to chase the chicken off and a rhinoceros&nbsp;opposed to the idea of
animal suits entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chicken was to follow the Labour leader, who was campaigning in
the marginal Tory seat held by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary. However, his efforts to henpeck Mr Blair were hampered by
a man from the Scottish Daily Mirror dressed as Freddy the Fox, who
blocked his path during a 15-minute walkabout.</p>
<p>As Mr Blair approached, the chicken was seen to stumble and was
pushed to the back of the crowd surrounding the Labour leader, where
it waved a placard before skulking off. A jubilant Freddy observed:
&quot;I had him for dinner. I stopped him getting anywhere near Tony.
Tony shook my hand and thanked me for it.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Mr Blair's guardian refused to identify himself, saying:
&quot;The whole thing is embarrassing enough as it is.&quot; The incident came
at the end of a traumatic day for the Tory chicken. Earlier, he got
into a nasty fight with a rival chicken with a detachable head, sent
by the Mirror newspaper, as he strutted across College Green in
Westminster. He was also pursued across London by another fox, two
teddy bears and a plastic rhinoceros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/rantext/random-politics/the-tory-chicken-loses-its-head">That whole
article</a>
is worth a read if only for the full description of the Chicken's fight
with the Mirror Chicken (the Mirror would go on to send another chicken
<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8633049.stm">after
Cameron</a>,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/09/article-1275443-097E59F4000005DC-503_634x424.jpg">Clegg</a>&nbsp;and
probably others&nbsp;in the 2010 election).&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Finkelstein has a good
story about having to keep the Chicken motivated during the campaign,
but it's sadly now lost behind the Times paywall. In happier
news,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://takingliberties.squarespace.com/taking-liberties/2010/4/18/class-of-97-tony-blair-and-the-tory-chicken.html">here's the
story</a>
of its visit to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Chickens have also popped up in
<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.canoe.ca/raisinghell/general/doer-smarter-than-your-average-chicken/">Canadian&nbsp;provincial&nbsp;elections</a>
so there's a fair chance&nbsp;I've missed several chicken sightings but the
idea of using chickens to draw attention to lack of debates (and assign
blame) seem to be a recurring thing here. Given this back story, what do
we make of this latest chicken? &nbsp;That the real Boris doesn't even appear
in Ken's chicken's videos so far (and that it's not explained in video
why there's a chicken) is interesting as the chicken&nbsp;usually&nbsp;tries to
muscle in on it's target's event and steal the focus.&nbsp;Is chasing fake
Boris a sign of laziness or a sign that the media landscape is changing
and our use of chicken suits with it? &nbsp;Do&nbsp;we now understanding a chicken
suit as short-hand for dodging debates? Or does the lack of context of
the clip&nbsp;reflect the changing face of media, that it's now better to get
a short and intriguing video on the internet and draw people to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.borisjohnshen.com/">your
site</a> than to try and worm in at your
opponent's own media events?</p>
<p>For entirely unrelated reasons, <a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/203347/voting-in-nevada-dont-wear-a-chicken-suit">you can't vote in a chicken-suit in
Nevada</a>.</p>
