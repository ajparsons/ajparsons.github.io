					<p>(This post contains spoilers - if you’re planning to play probably don’t
read? But you can if you want. I'm not your dad or
anything.)</p>
<p>In Gone Home, only one thing really happens. You read letters, you put
tapes into cassette players, gain access to parts of the house initially
locked off, but there is only one action you take that causes the world
to change irrevocably (and while effective, it’s a bit of a cheat
really). I think this more than anything gives a feel for the kind of
game this is, one based around reflective discovery rather than action.
The world is interactive, but only really transforms in the sense that
your understanding of it changes.</p>
<p>But let’s backtrack and set the scene: It’s a dark and stormy night in
1995, player character Katie has been travelling round Europe and has
now returned home - only her family has moved and now the family house
is a place she’s never been, a house where they never finished
unpacking, where items from different eras and lives lie alongside each
other. A house where no one’s home.</p>
<p>You make your way through the house, gradually turn on the lights and
encounter the artifacts of your family’s life while you were away. As
the game progresses, three different but interconnected stories become
apparent:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Young love blooming - the story of younger sister Sam falling in love
and discovering her sexual identity - told explicitly at the player
through voiceover.</li>
<li>Marriage on the rocks - All has not been well for Katie’s parents
while she’s been away, their professional lives are on different
tracks and personally they’re drifting apart - learned through
correspondence with third parties scattered through the house.</li>
<li>Buried family history - Katie’s father Terrance was abused by his
uncle Oscar in this house -&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better">&nbsp;discoverable only from inference from
the artifacts around the
house</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thread is arguably the main story, the game ‘finishes’
(credits roll but you can still return to the house) when this story
reaches it’s end but what’s neat is it’s actually possible to get right
through the game without getting much of the third story at all. It
takes a lot of self-confidence to essentially hide so much of a story
that feeds into it’s other threads - making discovery of that story an
internal experience for the player - ‘show, don’t tell’ taken to an
extreme.</p>
<p>The most prominent way the story is told is through the voice-over of
extracts from Sam's journal - which in the initial entry we're told she
is using as a substitute for her normal conversations with Katie and so
is structured as a series of letters to the player character. The
distinction between player and character in the game has been most
looked at with the time the <a class="reference external" href="http://deadpixel.co/2013/08/not-gonna-happen/">character puts down and won't pick up
again</a> a diary entry
where Sam describes her first sexual experience with her girlfriend
(Katie’s ‘voice’ in the story is otherwise only really ‘heard’ through
the hover-over description she gives certain items) but to me the most
important distinction is the player is hearing these voice-overs,
contextualising objects with a history - Katie is not. Katie doesn't
come into possession of the letters until the last second of the game -
until that point the player has much more knowledge of what’s going on
than she does.</p>
<p>This actually also throws the diary entry into a different light -
without the voice-overs to guide us through the nascent relationship
Katie has a very different set of information to the player. She is
given a few visual hints that her sister is gay (a men's magazine in her
locker earns a 'oh my' label) and that there's a interestingly prominent
girl in her life, but this is I believe the first time Katie learns that
the relationship is romantic/sexual. We also have no idea exactly what
Katie's opinion of her sister's sexuality is. Katie is more
'conventional' than her sister - she actually answered the question on
her sex ed paper unlike Sam's (amazing) short story on the subject. The
player, eighteen years later on the far side of 'don't ask/don't tell'
(which is a period detail now!) and primed by hearing the story of young
love in Sam's own voice, might well be be feeling much more comfortable
with this than Katie is in that moment. We simply don't know. The player
character is going through an emotional journey at a very different rate
to the player and there's an interesting possibility of dissonance
there. Similarly in the final movement from cupboard under the stairs to
the attic, the player has been primed by the voiceover to expect
something very different to what Katie might be thinking - did you run?
Would Katie have?</p>
<p>As the genre demands the house is riddled with secret passages and
hidden doors (mostly justified, the passages all make sense as giving
servants access to certain parts of the house without crossing the main
spaces). As the story is essentially structured geographically,
staggering access to these passages allows for something open plan (a
house) to be re-funneled into a mostly linear story.&nbsp;This isn’t just
used as a structure convenience, creeping around these poorly lit
passages is used to put you in the world of the several different sets
of characters have also used these passages - creeping behind the
acceptable history and ideas of the family. Sam and her girlfriend use
the passages for privacy, but there’s also the inference that the
passage to the guest room is how uncle Oscar got his nephew from the
second floor down to the recesses off the basement undetected (to
reinforce this, an artifact of Oscar is found underneath the door frame
at the top of the passage, while an artifact of Terrance is found in the
cupboard at the end of the route in the basement- a path connected by
objects out of place).</p>
<p>Much has been written about how <a class="reference external" href="http://iam.benabraham.net/2013/08/gone-home-jump-scares-and-ludonarative-harmony/">Gone Home plays with and subverts
horror
tropes</a>
- there’s the light-bulb that coincidently breaks the moment the player
examines a creepy object (the ‘one action’ I’m talking about in the
first paragraph) but there’s also the the blood-stained bath with the...
oh, hair dye bottle next to it. One particular way the game mixes mood
and game design to create a storytelling moment is so simple it’s
genius. Coming out of the basement there’s a staircase with a pipe
running along the ceiling, as you move up the stairs the way a section
of the pipe breaks against the light at the top of the stairs gives the
illusion (as the shape of the section cutting off the light changes) of
a figure moving at the top. So far, so creepy - but this staircase is
along that path from guest bedroom to basement and once you've got the
idea of a shadowy figure moving up those stairs your brain is engaged
(even after you realise it’s just a pipe) and you might wonder why, if
there was one, a shadowy figure might be taking that particular route -
a clue to help you twig aspects of the Oscar story. Possible I'm
over-reading into that, but the possibility of story-telling through
optical illusion is a nifty thing.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting little meta-commentary about the game’s use of
horror game conventions in the change in Terrance’s novels over time. In
the basement there’s a note from Terrance’s father, an english lit
scholar commending him on publication of his sci-fi novel but commenting
harshly that the book is bound by cliché and genre conventions - a
phrase from this letter &quot;You can do better&quot; is recreated on big sheets
of paper in the office (you discover these in the opposite order,
transforming the faintly pathetic mantra into a deeply depressing one as
you find the source).</p>
<p>By the end of the story Terrance’s confidence has been revitalised and
he has after twenty years completed another novel in his time-travel
series- described as more introspective (where the hero doesn't save the
President's life but his own!) - trying to finally live up to his dad's
instruction to complete himself as an artist by turning inward, but in a
way that rejects the idea that it is the genre conventions that were
holding him back. I see this as a comment on ‘Gone Home’ itself and the
idea that video games can only become ‘art’ if they ditch the
conventions of their more populist output. The game does neat things in
part because the world it creates is so aware of genre expectations and
sees their inclusion (and subversion) as a way to deepen the experience
it creates. An introspective novel with a time machine.</p>

					<p><em>(Spoilers for Black Mirror, &nbsp;11/22/63&nbsp;- minor spoilers for
Caprica,&nbsp;Buffy, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf - but you know, read it anyway.)</em></p>
<p>At what point does it become wrong to want to change the way things are?</p>
<p>While it is natural to want this at the heart of so many stories is the
idea that at some point trying to change the universe becomes unhealthy
and&nbsp;monstrous. Anxiety in this mould about technological progress has
been a feature of science fiction since the beginning - but anxiety
about technological progress&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;really about technology, what
‘science is bad’ is really saying is that people are bad and that the
ability science gives us to control our own destiny will distort and
twist us in the most fundamental ways.</p>
<p>Black Mirror definitely buys into this relationship between the bad
people and their toys. <em>The National Anthem</em> argues that modern
technology is bringing us closer to animals rather than lifting us above
(although I’m not convinced the story <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/12/black-mirror-the-media-and-the-mob/">pulled off the mob aspect that
well</a>),
<em>The Entire History of You</em> and <em>Be Right Back</em> share a theme that the
imperfection of memory is a blessing that keeps us from living in the
past and technology that allows us to re-experience things we’ve lost
keeps us from growing as people.</p>
<p><em>Be Right Back</em>&nbsp;deals with Martha, who after the death of her husband
(Ash) is signed up to a internet start-up that given access to the
social media profiles of the dead can recreate their personality, given
voice samples can call you on the phone, and given photos (plus money)
can send you a robot to take their place. This shares a lot of DNA with
the Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica, where a major set of plot
threats are various character’s ambitions for protagonist Zoe’s (who
‘dies’ in the first episode) resurrection&nbsp;computer program. Like <em>Be
Right Back</em>, Caprica’s method of resurrection is based on the equivalent
of scouring social networks and the internet but in Caprica’s case this
is actually good enough and the end results are effectively perfect
copies of the original people.</p>
<p>In <em>Be Right Back</em> Robot Ash’s presence is harmful because he
simply&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;a good enough copy to replace the original, what was meant
to displace grief ends up extending it. Caprica looks more towards the
social fallout of the possible end of death. From Clarice’s plans to
create a heaven for martyrs of her religion to Daniel’s plans to sell
the technology and make it available widely (complete with promo video
of a man stepping out from behind his coffin to his grieving family)
there is no doubt that the technology works, simply how it is going to
be used. Robot Ash is flawed because the story model requires a fatal
flaw (like these <a class="reference external" href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/">great tales of caveman science
fiction</a>).
Using technology (or magic) to address your desires (resulting from
ambition, grief) will only create monsters - either figurative or
literal.</p>
<p>Something that’s fun with these kind of stories is to think about how
the possible future society that’s got over these issues will look back
on them. If you could be resurrected from your social networks and it
could be perfect - would this be wrong? Would resurrection really be so
bad for us as a society? If the technology was perfect (say people made
regular backups) would a version of Ash who could only talk out of a
mobile phone be a completely different order than if the car accident
had just paralysed him? Isn’t it really another degree of the great
spectrum of disability? What I wonder is if this is the kind of attitude
that people in a few hundred years are going to find rather quaint -
will they be horrified at the&nbsp;frailness&nbsp;of all those people who went
through their lives without the wifi chip in their skull taking backups,
and a little amused that we thought their deathless society would be an
unnatural, wrong place?</p>
<p>The end of death is one of the keystones of the transhumanist future and
different approaches abound everywhere in science fiction. In
Bear’s&nbsp;<em>Eon</em>&nbsp;universe, the inhabitants of Axis City get two chances in
a physical body before an indefinite existence in city memory. In
Clarke’s<em>&nbsp;City and The Star</em>s in order to make immortality viable
over millions of years without society growing stale (which fails, but
anyway) the people of Diaspar use a form of reincarnation, where people
are given twenty years or so to establish new lives before their
previous memories are returned to them. In Red Dwarf dead crew can be
bought back to life as holograms and the dead are a growing force in
society, when Rimmer is whining about being dead Lister just argues that
“death isn’t the handicap it used to be in the olden days.
It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;screw your career up the way it used to”.</p>
<p>There is a similar approach to the sanctity of death in fantasy where,
despite the otherwise strangeness of the world, often reversing ‘natural
death’ remains an uncrossable line. Magical worlds that co-exist with
the real world tend to certain rules to explain why the real world is
only superficially altered from our own with the addition of these
fantastic elements, usually in some form of unwritten Prime Directive of
non-interference - the specific problem being that magical rules tend to
be fair (in the sense that all actions can be reversed - at a cost)
whereas the real world is notably for being distinctly unfair. Harry
Potter's world has a host of magical ailments for magical healers to fix
but St Mungo’s doesn’t go around curing muggles of cancer. In Buffy,
Joyce and Tara are explicitly unable to be resurrected through magical
means because of the non-magical nature of the deaths and season five’s
<em>Forever</em> dwells on the horrificness of trying to break this rule. While
the real- and other-world mix to some degree, real-world death is
repeatedly treated as a line the other just can't cross, or at least not
lightly.</p>
<p>In science fiction this comes up quite a lot in stories about time
travel - attempts to fix real-world wrongs using otherworldly
time-travel are frequently the source rather than remedy of regret.
As<em>&nbsp;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe</em> puts it
&quot;within a science fictional space, memory and regret are, when taken
together, the set of necessary and sufficient elements required to
produce a time machine&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Whoverse this happens most explicitly
in <em>Father’s Day</em> when Rose's attempt to save her father literally
breaks the story-world apart and lets monsters in from beyond the fourth
wall to teach her a lesson. The Tenth Doctor's “Time Lord Victorious”
speech in <em>Waters of Mars</em> is effectively him declaring his refusal to
let his otherworldlyness bind his actions, hubris the story punishes him
for in short succession. However this is a line that Who is increasingly
fuzzy on, at the end of the <em>The Almost People</em> the Doctor gives Cleaves
what is in effect a magic potion to fix the brain clot in her brain.
Like Joyce’s aneurysm in Buffy, the clot isn't caused by the Doctor or
the events of the story, it's presented as a decidedly human problem
that's solved (in a moment) through magical means. Similarly, in last
year’s Christmas episode a normal man was flying back in a doomed plane
from a normal war and is rescued from death through essentially magical
means.</p>
<p>When a story is showing the dark side of Trying To Change How Things
Were it tends to show history breaking in two ways. In Red Dwarf’s
<em>Tikka to Ride</em> Kennedy’s assassination is accidentally prevented,
leading to an alternate history where Kennedy’s failings of a president
are given time to play out, leading to an earlier and different end to
the Cold War where the future the show is set in no longer exist, while
in Stephen King’s <em>11/22/63</em> time&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;want to be changed, and the
act of doing so on a large enough scale (preventing the Kennedy
assassination) breaks the universe, with earthquakes, disasters and a
decay of the laws of physics. One teaches the a lesson that history is
complicated and events have unexpected repercussions, the other that
meddling in the past is just Wrong with a capital W and you will be
punished for doing so.</p>
<p>At their core Black Mirror and the range of similar stories&nbsp;are
essentially conservative in the 'people aren't getting any better'
sense, but this also spills over into 'attempts to make people better
will always fail' - because the one thing we certainly can't be trusted
to change right is ourselves.&nbsp;A future where people play pick 'n' mix
with their memories, change history on a whim, and the dead walk on the
streets demanding equal rights is certainly weird and unsettling to us
today - but wouldn’t they find stories demanding a ‘dead’ person go away
so everyone else can move on a little bit horrifying themselves?</p>

					<p>Bit late to get around to this, but here's a quick round-up of
everything I wrote on the blog last year (in vague theme groupings):</p>
<p>There have been posts about&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/02/political-chickens/">the history of chicken suits in

in a piece of high-nerdery worked out&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/electoral-reform-at-the-oscars/">the exact problem in the

an attempt to make sense of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/the-strange-maths-of-mandates/">weird world of political

<p>I ended up writing a fair amount on the Scottish&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;referendum
-&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/indyref-round-up/">I&nbsp;summarised arguments made to the Scottish Affairs

looked at the<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/votes-at-16-in-scotland/">practical implications of votes at 16 in

and thought that <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/scottish-independence-and-the-electoral-register/">early&nbsp;Westminster&nbsp;arguments about electoral register
seemed
spurious</a>.&nbsp;On
the release of section 30 order I noticed it <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/designated-campaigns-for-an-independence-referendum/">seemed to be giving
&nbsp;powers to the Scottish Parliament it said it
wasn't</a>,
something <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/update-on-designated-campaigns/">that seemed to be
confirmed</a>
a few months later. &nbsp;Still not sure where that one's going. (and from
2011 -&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/">a post on multiple questions and ballot

<p>Looking at democratic stuff, I wrote there's a good case to be made
for&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">allowing fractional voting below

argument about

article</a>
in the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post&nbsp;has been rightly widely condemned as being a
pretty horrible thing for a mainstream newspaper to publish (even
bearing in mind the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post also published a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">he went too far,
but is he
wrong?</a>&quot;&nbsp;article
after&nbsp;Brievik), one part especially jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
THE DESIRE to prevent harm to innocent civilians in Gaza will
ultimately lead to harming the truly innocent: the residents of
southern Israel. <strong>The residents of Gaza are not innocent, they
elected Hamas. The Gazans aren’t hostages; they chose this freely,
and must live with the consequences.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you remember 7/7 bomber&nbsp;Mohammad Sidique Khan's suicide tape, that
might be
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm">familiar&nbsp;sentiment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Your <strong>democratically elected governments</strong> continuously perpetuate
atrocities against my people all over the world.&nbsp;And <strong>your support
of them makes you directly responsible</strong>, just as I am directly
responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and
sisters.</blockquote>
<p>The principle here is simple: we elect our leaders, if our leaders chose
to wage war with our support then we are all legitimate targets, in or
out of uniform, on or off the battlefield. &nbsp;It's not just to weaken the
material war effort or 'morale' of the enemy (dodgy, but anyway),
democratic civilians are morally culpable and so&nbsp;indiscriminate&nbsp;violence
can be justified.</p>
<p>As it happens Sharon is just plain wrong on the facts, Hamas did win the
2006 elections but the current Hamas government in Gaza results from a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4">2007 takeover</a>.
More interesting for this question is exactly why they won in 2006 - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jps.2006.35.3.20">a
combination of the electoral system and severe splits within
Fatah</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Post-election surveys showed the price of this disunity, a
distortion magnified&nbsp;by an electoral system under which half the
seats were won in district races[at-large elections with multiple
seats] and the other half—the national list—were allocated according
to the list’s&nbsp;proportion of the national vote. Thus, Hamas won 29
seats (against Fatah’s 28)&nbsp;in the 66-seat national list with 44
percent of the vote. The non-Hamas vote&nbsp;(56 percent)was divided
between Fatah and the four other PLO or “Third Way”&nbsp;lists. But while
Hamas candidates won 45 (68 percent) of the 66 district seats&nbsp;in
parliament, they did so with 36.5 of the vote. Sixty-three percent
voted for&nbsp;non-Hamas candidates, the vast majority dispersed between
Fatah’s official and&nbsp;independent candidates. In the end, Fatah won a
mere 17 seats in the districts.&nbsp;On the basis of these figures it is
difficult to refute Awad’s conclusion. “Hamas&nbsp;did not win the
elections—Fatah lost them.” (p.26)</blockquote>
<p>That 36.5% figure is interesting because Labour in the 2005 elections
won with just a percent less, on 35.2% percent of the vote. &nbsp;In both
cases the 'culpable party' won with far less than majority support - can
we really say there's a lot of collective&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;there?</p>
<p>But wait - those are the figures for the whole of Palestine - maybe the
Gaza districts were more Hamas hardcore. No such luck, using the break
down of results from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/Palestine2006-NDI-final.pdf">Carter Center
report</a>
I made this table of how the vote played out (remember it's at-large
districts- as many votes as seats open - so there are many more votes
than voters):</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="44%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="17%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>District</strong></td>
<td><strong>Votes for Change &amp; Reform (Hamas)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Total Votes</strong></td>
<td><strong>&nbsp;% Hamas</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>North Gaza</td>
<td>170021</td>
<td>363832</td>
<td>46.73%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Gaza</td>
<td>364529</td>
<td>941959</td>
<td>38.70%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Deir al-Balah</td>
<td>79594</td>
<td>253882</td>
<td>31.35%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Khan Younis</td>
<td>160014</td>
<td>531480</td>
<td>30.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Rafah</td>
<td>61936</td>
<td>153247</td>
<td>40.42%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Total</td>
<td>836094</td>
<td>2244400</td>
<td>37.25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So even just within Gaza it's hard to argue Hamas had overwhelming
support.&nbsp;It's also worth remembering that Gaza has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html">a pretty high
proportion of
children</a>
(43.8% - 0-14) and so democratic decisions by the adult population
have&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/">more potential legitimacy
problems</a>&nbsp;than
might otherwise be the case. Saying children 'chose freely' to be bombed
because less than half of adults voted for a party six years ago might
be pushing democratic accountability a bit far.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/13147230-198x300.jpg" />After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/terry-pratchett-sex-death-and-nature">this great
interview</a>
with Terry Pratchett&nbsp;I decided to go back and finish this post I was
writing about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth">*The Long
Earth*</a>, Pratchett's
recent collaboration with Stephen Baxter.&nbsp;Obviously, spoilers spoilers.</p>
<p>Basic setting summary: In <em>The Long Earth</em>, someone releases schematics
on the internet for an easy to build box with a switch. When the switch
is pressed, the user can travel either 'east' or 'west' through
infinite&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;Earths, with the near Earths being very similar to the
original 'datum' earth (but lacking in people) with weirder and wilder
creatures waiting in the far off Earths.&nbsp;One of the fun things about
reading collaborations between well-known authors is trying to break
down who introduced what elements.&nbsp;Sometimes you can pick up the voices,
but in cases like the Long Earth tracking the lineage of the ideas
involved is illuminating.&nbsp;While based on an old idea of Pratchett's, the
threads of it have appeared in a few previous Baxter books (which is
probably why the project is such a good fit.)</p>
<p>In Baxter's <em>Origin</em>, the world is changed by the&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of the Red
Moon (which replaces the boring grey one). The Red Moon travels
from&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;earth to parallel earth, opening up portals and picking up
and depositing creatures from world to world. Through this, it picked up
humanity's&nbsp;predecessors at various points in history and deposited them
on other earths, where they evolve in different and similar ways,
aquatic apes, puritans with tails, super-intelligent&nbsp;gorillas who hug
the surface of their gigantic and windswept Earth. So the idea that
there are places beside our own where humanity's cousins (in <em>The Long
Earth</em>'s case Trolls and Elves) developed in their own strange ways is
a&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>That Trolls are largely peaceful creatures who make people feel better
by singing while Elves are intelligent, malicious hunters where some
species farm others for their brains fits into the Pratchett&nbsp;rebellion
against Tolkien regarding elves (from <em>Lords and Ladies)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are terrific. They beget terror.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a
snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words
that have changed their meaning.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">No one ever said elves are nice.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are bad.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Long Earth</em> is also an example of, &nbsp;for lack of a better term,
&quot;Democratic Science Fiction&quot; - where an extraordinary change is put in
the hands of every person.&nbsp;What's a world like where everyone has
superpowers?&nbsp;&nbsp;When anyone can travel in time? When anyone can get a
potato and a switch, and step into another earth? This is ground Baxter
has visited before in a previous&nbsp;collaboration with Arthur C. Clark in
<em>The Light Of Other Days</em>, where the invention of wormhole technology
allows anyone to view any location, anywhere in history - effectively
abolishing privacy.</p>
<p>Lobsang is an interesting element, a sentient computer that claims to be
the reincarnated soul of a&nbsp;Tibetan&nbsp;car mechanic.&nbsp;Someone obscure
being&nbsp;reincarnated&nbsp;as a computer feels like a classic Pratchett&nbsp;footnote
joke (and there has been a 'Lobsang' in the Discworld-verse) , but it's
tempered and kept in line with a sci-fi universe by the heavy hinting
that Lobsang is just pretending to be reincarnated&nbsp;to have a better
claim to have personhood rights. To make an end of paragraph habit,
Baxter's collaboration with Clarke in the <em>Time Odyssey</em>&nbsp;series also
featured AI's with recognised rights.</p>
<p>You might guess from how often I've referred back to his previous books
that this story 'feels' more like Baxter than Pratchett but
his&nbsp;sensibilities&nbsp;are clearly there if you look. I wouldn't say it's
either of their greatest works, but it's a perfectly enjoyable read that
plays with its world in a way that I'm not sure would have come
naturally to either of them on their own.</p>

					<p>The other month someone posted this classic 'politicians are awful'
viral story on Facebook, &nbsp;I was reading&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">David Graeber's
Debt</a> at the
same time and it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me what a wonderful summation this story is
of a certain kind of debt morality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. After the cut, he
asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money
from you; I'm doing community service this week.' The florist was
pleased and left the shop. When the barber went to open his shop the
next morning, there was a 'thank you' card and a dozen roses waiting
for him at his door.</p>
<p>Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his
bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you; I'm
doing community service this week.' The cop was happy and left the
shop. The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a
'thank you' card and a dozen doughnuts waiting for him at his door.</p>
<p>Then an MP came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill,
the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing
community service this week.' The MP was very happy and left the
shop. The next morning, when the barber went to open up, there were
a dozen MPs lined up waiting for a free haircut.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between
the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we have the evil MPs (it's an anglicised&nbsp;US story, other versions
on the internet use 'politicians') are happy to take the humble barber
for all they can, while the upstanding members of the community show
their gratitude with gifts, and are thus good people.</p>
<p>But wait, wasn't the barber trying to perform community service? Didn't
he say he didn't want money? Why is it good to sneakily leave gifts of,
in the florist's case, at least equivalent&nbsp;monetary value when he can't
refuse? The barber tried to give to the community but the cop and the
florist go against his wishes and try to pay him, because of the
discomfort of the cop and florist to even the perception of being in
another's debt.</p>
<p>Graeber comes into this because he argues that the role of barter is to
manage goods between strangers but in long-standing communities credit
arrangements dominate. Something that caught my eye was that in some
societies, to try to clear all debts would be an absurdity because to
try would be to decide not to be a member of the community.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it's the florist and cop who are determined to
treat the barber as a stranger by not allowing a debt to stand
uncompensated,&nbsp;whereas the MP spreads word of someone who wants to give
and gives them the opportunity to give more. Who's really the bad guy in
this scenario?&nbsp;I find it interesting how revealing a story clearly meant
to represent 'common sense' is about a particular modern idea of debt
and community.</p>
