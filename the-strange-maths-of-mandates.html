there's some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#a60">interesting
discussion</a>
of if a referendum is required or&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;before reform can proceed.</p>
<p>Alongside the standard argument that major constitutional change should
require a referendum is the idea that as all three major parties entered
into the last election with a manifesto commitment&nbsp;to Lords reform, no
party has a mandate to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;Lords reform. This is on the face of
it, puzzling - if a policy is so popular that all parties feel
it&nbsp;advantageous&nbsp;to put in their&nbsp;manifesto how can whatever government
results not have a mandate as a result? Here's what was said (or
summarized at the end if you want to skip):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="373">
<li>...The Government's view is that:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;because all three parties were in favour of this, we did not think
that a referendum was justified. When the House of Lords
Constitution Committee looked at referendums, it said that it
thought that abolition of the House of Lords would be a subject on
which you would automatically want to have a referendum, but it did
not say that changing the composition of the House of Lords would be
such a proposition. So, no, we do not think that a referendum is
necessary, and that is why we did not propose it in our draft Bill
or White
Paper&quot;.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note438">438</a>]</p>
<p>373. Despite the constitutional importance of the subject, the lack
of a clear party division on the issue means that any opposition to
the proposed reform cannot readily be tested at any future election
by voting for one or other candidates seeking election to the House
of Commons. If the Government has its way, the draft Bill will have
become an Act before the next general election, at which the first
tranche of elected Members of a reformed House of Lords would be
seeking election. There is thus no opportunity for the electorate to
provide a mandate for these
proposals.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note439">439</a>]</p>
<p>374. Mr Christopher Hartigan, who described himself as &quot;a member of
the public with an interest in constitutional matters and Lords
Reform in particular&quot; put it:</p>
<p>The fact that elections were mentioned in the three manifestoes does
not mean it is the settled view of a party, it is not, or the
majority of members of a party agree with it or that the electorate
want it either. It can be said that the fact that it was in three
manifestos makes it clear that the people had no choice. It should
also be remembered all three parties LOST the election. ... If the
government believe this is the will of the people then it should
proceed on a free vote of their representatives or hold a
constitutional referendum before such important changes are made.</p>
<p>377. Professor Vernon Bogdanor told us in oral evidence that a
referendum would be the right way forward because all three parties
proposed an elected Lords in their election manifestos in 2010, so
there was no way for the voter to indicate his or her opinion: &quot;I
think it would be right to hold a referendum on this issue, which I
think is a greater change than the alternative vote system that has
been rejected&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substantial argument here is that&nbsp;politically popular is not the
same as popularly popular, the policy&nbsp;could in fact be a stitch-up among
the political class to deny choice on a certain issue while
the&nbsp;truly&nbsp;popular policy goes unexpressed.&nbsp;The point about mandates is
that they result from the public having made a set of choices of Party A
over Party B, if there was no&nbsp;differentiation, there was no choice to be
made, thus no mandate.</p>
<p>This makes the maths of mandates somewhat counter-intuitive. If we
imagine rival parties A and B and the mandate for policy X, we end up
with this strange table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>Party A</strong></td>
<td><strong>Party B</strong></td>
<td><strong>Mandate</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>A has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Y</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If no party is in support, there is no mandate for X, if every party is
in support, there is no mandate for X.&nbsp;If we take the idea of mandates
seriously for a minute this means if&nbsp;the other side steals your good
idea, then suddenly they've taken away your mandate to implement it.
Does that mean that policy X should be put to a referendum to gain its
mandate? Or if arguing that that's reserved for constitutional issues
(which X may not be),&nbsp;does it mean the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention">Salisbury
doctrine</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2011/07/04/salisbury-lords-reform-history/">if it
still
exists</a>)
shouldn't apply because X doesn't really have a mandate from the nation?</p>
<p>Added to that is a question of how different policies X and Y need to be
before the public can be said to have offered&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;choice. While
all three&nbsp;manifestos pledged to reform the House of Lords, Labour
differed in requiring a referendum, the Conservatives only committed to
a 'mainly-elected' chamber - are those differentiation enough that
voters had a choice?&nbsp;Labour wanted open-list PR, if the Lib Dems had put
their preference for STV into the manifesto would that have been making
a choice?</p>
<p>In this case the argument is limited to saying that an issue that would
otherwise require a referendum can go without if the election was fought
out on a very specific set of circumstances, but the general principle
is worth thinking about&nbsp;as&nbsp;there are any number of areas where overlap
between the parties is large. &nbsp;The argument is that certain manifesto
combinations shouldn't be given practical&nbsp;significance, but the
fiddlyness of the situation that results seems to argue pretty well that
manifesto&nbsp;commitments&nbsp;shouldn't have practical&nbsp;significance full stop.</p>
<p>This ultimately comes down to the old question of what exactly happens
in an election - are we empowering people to decide or people to
deliver? At various times manifestos were certainly viewed as binding -
Stanley Baldwin claimed the 1923 election was held solely to reverse a
manifesto&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;of his&nbsp;predecessor[1. Dennis Kavangh, '<a class="reference external" href="http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIV/1/7.extract">The
Politics of
Manifestos</a>',&nbsp;Parliamentary&nbsp;Affairs,
34(1),1981 ,p.8] - but Kavanagh argues that this becomes
increasingly&nbsp;untenable&nbsp;in the modern age:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead of the mandate referring to a major issue, governments now
use the term to justify a battery of items in the manifesto, however
picayune they may be. As pledges are fulfilled, so the government
spokesman claims that he has kept faith with the electorate,
regardless of the popularity of the measure. But it is the sheer
number of proposals in modern manifestos which weakens the notion of
the mandate as the conscious support of each manifesto proposal by a
person who votes for the party. It is because voters for a party
simply cannot be expected to be aware of all of the proposals, let
alone agree with them, that Finer makes the charge of &quot;manifesto
moonshine &quot; [2. Ibid. p. 9]</blockquote>
<p>This raises the obvious&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;about the idea of mandates: when
voters enter the voting booth are they really endorsing the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of
that party's manifesto? Might their decision perhaps be&nbsp;influenced&nbsp;by
other considerations? Can a party really claim a mandate from the nation
for a vague&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;hidden in a footnote on page five underneath the
'beware of the leopard' sign?</p>
<p>I think it'd be fair to say that today (ignoring fiddly issues such as
the position of coalition agreements) while 'mandate' is thrown around
as a useful bit of&nbsp;language, the predominate mindset is that
governments&nbsp;can do anything they can practically achieve and
that&nbsp;manifestos only have practical, as opposed to political,
significant in odd (and probably doomed) cases like the Salisbury
doctrine - on the basis of the above it's hard to say there's much wrong
with this.</p>
<p>I remain a bit unsure if the&nbsp;cancelling&nbsp;maths of mandates is something
that should be taken seriously but given both accepting it and rejecting
it stress the idea of manifesto mandates to breaking point it does
illustrate the underlying concept is a bit fragile and shouldn't be too
heavily relied on.&nbsp;For Lords reform,&nbsp;this means that if a referendum is
needed (and I think would be the last chance for groups like Unlock
Democracy to establish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/the-public-should-have-the-power-to-veto-elected-lords-not-another-vanity-r">an alternative
principle</a>),
a referendum is needed - and that in general we should shy away from
arrangements that give much practical importance to manifesto promises
(while of course being free to politically punish parties for breaking
them).</p>
