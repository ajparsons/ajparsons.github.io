					<div><p>I went to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/parliamentary_boundary_review">a talk by Ron Johnston, Charles Pattie and David
Rossiter</a>
at the Constitution Unit yesterday on the in-progress boundary reviews
(their slides at link). It was interesting in the sense that it
confirmed with figures the kind of problems they’d previously predicted
with the review and I’m just going to throw down a few notes while it’s
fresh in my mind.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="building-blocks-and-displacement">
<h2>Building blocks and displacement</h2>
<div><p>This review represents the triumph, though possibly only temporarily, of
the mathematical principle (all constituencies should have equal numbers
of electors) over the organic principle (constituencies should reflect
real communities and locations) with a tighter than ever constraint on
elector numbers. A basic problem of requiring constituency electors to
fall within a certain range is that the building block used (wards) are
too often too big to construct constituencies within the range.</p>
<p>Interestingly the English and Scottish commissions have different ways
of dealing with this, the English method being to cross borders to make
up the numbers, whereas the Scottish commission splits wards. &nbsp;They
pretty conclusively demonstrated the Scottish method is less disruptive,
measured by relative numbers of ‘suboptimally&nbsp;placed (SP) electors’, who
are electors displaced from the majority of their compatriots in their
local authority, old constituency or ward. This does make sense
intuitively, as crossing borders pushes the imbalance over into the next
region and requires aggregate more slight movements of voters, but it’s
good to have numbers on it.</p>
<p>The idea that SPs should be minimized is a good measure, but I wonder if
the principle could be extended. If the proposed ‘one review a
parliament’ schedule is kept up, in the worst case you could find voters
who are moved around at every election - another possible measure would
be to try and minimize the number of people who have been SPs more than
once (TSPs?).</p>
<p>As the general trend is towards larger wards, they suggested using
polling districts as a possible smaller building block. The other option
they suggested in 2009 (with McLean) was

<h2>Public Hearings and political effects</h2>
<div><p>It was interesting to hear that the public hearings (essentially
curtailed versions of the public inquires) are still a vehicle for
parties even if their&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to input has been reduced (limited to 40
minute slots). This isn’t entirely surprising as parties have the
greatest interest in the result - I’m going to bring in here a bit here
something I wrote at the time the bill was going through about the
relationship between parties and the inquiries:</p>

 As boundary matters are decided in the UK by the apolitical Boundary
 Commission, what happens is whenever we have a debate about
 apportionment it rapidly becomes a debate about competing metrics of
 fairness, where each side just so happens to align with the position
 that's seen to result in a better deal for them. Natural population
 movement tends to lead to more boundaries that favour Labour over
 time and so in general Labour has been opposed both to frequent
 redistributions and now, very clearly, stricter equalisation. It's
 not a coincidence that it's the same party that postponed the
 acceptance of new boundaries until after the election in 1969 is now
 dragging it's feet in the Lords but equally the Conservative
 position isn't much deeper, if situations were reversed I've no
 doubt we'd see the same in the other direction. However, that a
 position has political advantages doesn't stop it being a correct
 one.

 …

 It's interesting that one of concessions given in the Lords seems to
 be `the return of public
 inquiries <http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6661493/wheeling-and-dealing-over-the-av-bill.thtml>`__
 as I thought that removing them was one of the more interesting
 elements of the plan. Public inquiries have a number of issues, they
 make the process very time consuming (which is an issue if we're
 going to have to have a review every parliament), tend to increase
 deviations from the quota size, but most importantly public inquires
 are one of the few ways for political parties to influence the
 decision of the Boundary Commission. What you sometimes get is that
 political parties will show up at the Inquiry with alternate plans,
 which as long as they fulfil the commission's criteria better than
 the Commission's own plan it has no grounds to reject on the basis
 that it's more partisan[1. Lots of interesting discussion of this in
 D. J Rossiter, R.J Johnson, and C. J Pattie, The Boundary
 Commissions: Redrawing the UKʼs map of Parliamentary Constituencies,
 (Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2009), pp. 246-262] .
 Being apolitical means it can't consider the political consequences
 of its work, this is far from saying there are none. Given the
 inherent political nature of their work, Richard Morill `makes the
 interesting
 argument <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X2W-4XSF2CP-3&_user=10&_coverDate=07%2F31%2F1987&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1626703844&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=d2b5fce8f7a5050618d81c54db5a1dcd&searchtype=a>`__
 that political ends should be directly considered by apportionment
 bodies and that they should set out to create certain numbers of
 safe and marginal seats rather than pretending its work has no
 impact on these questions, but its hard to see this view gaining
 much currency in British circles.

<div class="section" id="relationship-to-electoral-system">
<h2>Relationship to electoral system</h2>
<div><p>Something that was danced around in the Q&amp;A is the way in which the
boundary commission is related to the voting system. In many way the
boundary commission is the dark and complicated back-end of the ‘simple’
FPTP system (or any single-member system like AV) in that single-member
constituencies are smaller than multi-member constituencies, and so are
more vulnerable to population shifts (and the problem of building block
size mentioned earlier), plus the all-or-nothing nature of the systems
make the partisan implications of boundaries a bigger issue than they
might otherwise be. This isn’t a hugely live issue (as was pointed out
the boundary proposals might be unpopular among MPs but changing the
voting system is even more so) but it’s worth remembering it all fits
together.</p>
<p>While district magnitude and electoral system have effects on the
importance of boundaries, something that’s thought about less is that
ultimately the conflict between the organic and mathematical criteria
are the result of the fixing representative voting weight at ‘1’.
&nbsp;Trying to express both through the same measure (boundaries) inevitably
requires one to be prioritized over the other, what we need to do is
open up another stream to get the information into the chamber.</p>
<p>What Toplek
<a class="reference external" href="http://templelaw.tenintenclients.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toplak.pdf">proposes</a>[2.
Link takes you to pdf, but ref is:&nbsp;Jurij Toplak, ‘Equal voting weight of
all: Finally &quot;One Person, One Vote&quot; from Hawaii to Maine?’, Temple Law
Review, Vol. 81, 2008, pp. 123-178]&nbsp;in the context of the US is rather
than endlessly debate methods of dividing seats among the states on the
basis of their population, use any method but then give a state’s reps a
voting power that is equal to the population of that state. Using
representative voting weight as the means of expressing mathematical
equality frees up the boundary process to deviate in size to allow more
‘natural’ constituencies (even extreme deviations in size could then be
permitted within the system without being exceptions).</p>
<p>This doesn’t resolve all the problems of boundaries (safe seats, etc)
but it does resolve the current debate in a much easier (and cheaper)
way. &nbsp;Beyond that fix, [laying with representative voting weight opens
up a whole new realm of possible electoral structures, including methods
of dynamic apportionment which reduce the need for boundary reviews even
further and more exact methods of proportional representation. But
that’s a matter for future posts.</p>
