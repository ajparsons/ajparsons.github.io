					<p>If there's a housing crisis, why aren't we acting like it? Why is the
green belt <a class="reference external" href="http://www.citymetric.com/politics/london-mayoral-race-why-wont-labours-candidates-get-serious-about-housing-1353">a sacred
cow</a>
but affordable living not?</p>
<p>Going back to&nbsp;basics: &nbsp;'crisis' is an old medical work – meaning the
last time at which the patient can recover. Current meaning is closer to
‘decline that impairs ability to function’. This meaning can (and is)
deployed more often but lacks the urgency associated with original
meaning. Each year not building enough houses is creating more work for
future people&nbsp;to build more houses than the currently demonstrated
ability to do so. There is no date at which housing can be said to have
succeeded/failed. Eternal little (or in reality large) failures – but
we’ll do better next year. Never said – “this is a permanent failure
that requires radical action.”</p>
<p>People are very bad as saying ‘this has failed’ with ongoing processes.
We will produce less carbon in future than our current attitude and
resources suggests is likely – we will build more houses in future than
our current attitude and resources suggests is likely. Tomorrow is
someone else’s problem. The poor sap.</p>
<p>I think there's a fundamental disconnect in how people perceive ‘housing
crisis’. When I talk about a housing crisis I’m thinking of a situation
where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Too many people living in substandard housing – with no political
will to improve situation.</li>
<li>Too many people living in insecure housing (short tenure, other
people with physical access, risk of evictions) - with no political
will to improve situation.</li>
<li>The prices of living in this undesirable situation is constantly
rising – with no political will to improve situation.</li>
<li>At a more oblique level – a moral crisis. A rentier class extracts
wealth from another group who live in bad circumstances without
choice – making money from human misery. This class holds reasonable
lobbying power and sometimes as individuals direct political power.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes a ‘bad thing’ a crisis is that it is clear it will not just
recover on its own. Left to their own devices all the above will get
worse.</p>
<p>I think for most people a ‘housing crisis’ is more fundamental than
that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You either have a roof over your head or you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being on the street is a crisis, rent being expensive is not. This is
young people whining about being young and poor people whining about
being poor. Change the record. The situation is not bad enough to
re-examine fundamental assumptions (individual resistance to new local
building, cultural resistance to reducing green belts).</p>
<p>So where is the “real” housing crisis? There’s an idea in climate change
that there are ‘carbon sinks’ that absorb carbon from atmosphere but at
some point they will decline in effectiveness and rise in atmospheric
CO2 proceeds much quicker. &nbsp;This can&nbsp;be reduced to a metaphor – ‘a
device that commutes effect of bad thing but will eventually stop’. What
are housing’s carbon sinks? For a few:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Private landlords used to house people councils have legal duty
towards. Families housed in B&amp;Bs for extended periods, etc.</li>
<li>Children living with parents for longer.</li>
<li>Unsustainable high proportions of income being spent on rent. Many
people on brink of affordability – in crisis will be unable to
afford.</li>
</ul>
<p>First is most obvious give point – there is only so much housing that
can be used as emergency housing. To avoid the very bad thing of
children on the streets councils are shipping people to less expensive
areas. Headlines about people being taken away from their families and
lives – but reader might enter fairness paradigm at this point: ‘Why
should I pay so much to have a house in London and have the life I want
and someone else get it for free? If you can’t afford it you should go
somewhere cheaper’ (with even poorer job prospects, etc). So safety
valve on housing crisis folds into &quot;poor people want something for
nothing&quot; as opposed to “why is there nothing affordable?”</p>
<p>Second point is an obvious frustration to that generation and helps hide
full scale of housing shortage but again has obstacles to seeing it as a
real problem.</p>
<p>Fundamentally people want to believe in a just world and that people get
what they deserve. Children these days are just more dependent on their
parents, not like we were. A series of metaphors are deployed to mark
this generation as especially unable to cope outside the nest (itself a
metaphor for ‘maturity involves leaving home’). ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’ is
used as ‘kids will be financially irresponsible’ but also interestingly
‘too young to enter real financial world’. A requirement for
inter-generational wealth transfers appears to replace the institutions
and availability of capital that existed at an earlier time (and of
course, family wealth is not available to everyone) – but metaphor is
deployed as being between generations and reinforce idea of immaturity
of youth – not a comment on the different societies different
generations live in.</p>
<p>If a lot of people weren’t working hard to keep homelessness down (by
finding enterprising ways to move people around to some form of shelter)
or opting out of market (living longer with parents) there would be a
far more obvious homelessness crisis. It is a good thing there isn’t!
But we’re left with a perception gap.</p>
<p>People who need to believe there is a crisis (because they can stop
construction of required housing in the right places) don’t. This is a
large part of the problem.</p>

					<p>Quick extension to my <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2015/08/notes-on-shadow-work/">Lambert
notes</a>:&nbsp;the
history of pregnancy tests! Or things we believe that probably aren't
true.</p>
<p>Lambert's tendency (and to be fair, we all do this a bit) to view the
time of his upbringing as a natural thing to view the future against
runs into problems when we remember the modern age is both quick
changing and often quite weird historically.</p>
<blockquote>
In any case, home pregnancy tests remove the doctor’s office and
medical lab from the process. In days of yore, the pregnant woman
was not the first to learn of her status ; her doctor’s office
called with the joyous (or confounding) news. Now, only the woman
herself needs know she is with child. This grants her more privacy
and more control. It also transforms what can be a memorable shared
event into a solitary encounter with a plastic stick. The epiphany
occurs in a silo.</blockquote>
<p>This might be a culture clash thing, but privacy related to your own
body seems good. The need for a doctor to be involved here at all is
probably historically odd - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/05/the_quickening_the_momentous_pregnancy_event_that_became_a_relic.html">the
quickening</a>
was fairly private, while deemed legally significant. Mid-twentieth
century isn't 'days of yore'.</p>
<p>This led&nbsp;to some research on when pregnancy tests started to appear
historically. Various listicles will give&nbsp;you the fact&nbsp;the&nbsp;first
pregnancy test recorded was in Egypt in 1350BCE and
<a class="reference external" href="http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/thinblueline/timeline.html">involved&nbsp;urinating&nbsp;on
barley.</a>&nbsp;You'll
then also get told that this isn't actually a bad method! Everywhere I
look has a claim that there was a study in 1963 that found this method
was 70% accurate.</p>
<p>I'm a bit suspicious of this. I can't find this 1963 study - I can find
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/12/1/33.full.pdf">a review in
1966</a>
that refers to a study&nbsp;in the 1941&nbsp;which&nbsp;found this test gave results
where&nbsp;&quot;75% were correctly positive and 85% correctly negative&quot;.</p>
<p>I can't trace it further than this - I can't find a copy of the original
article easily accessibly anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's possible it's everything the
summary says it is - but we can't be sure. Googling the author and
keywords gives us <a class="reference external" href="http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2603765&amp;blobtype=pdf">this interesting
summary</a>
which also expresses doubt on the validity of the Egyptian method as
&quot;human urine may contain plant hormones which stimulate plant
growth,&nbsp;but the level of these hormones does not appear to increase in
pregnancy (pg 19).</p>
<p>So I'm sceptical of the whole thing now. Don't trust the internet.</p>

					<p>I've reached the point in my suicide contagion project where new
research is starting to fit very nicely into the final framework (which
hopefully suggests I'm onto something, or alternatively that I've&nbsp;become
blind to contrary information - either/or). Today I read some new
research by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279630540_Crisis_Phones__Suicide_Prevention_Versus_SuggestionContagion_Effects">Stack
(2015)</a>
on if crisis phones on bridges were an effective means of suicide
prevention.</p>
<p>What he found was a little unsettling.&nbsp;We know people use them (good!)
and that these people tend not to&nbsp;jump (also good!) but did suicides on
the bridge increase or decrease after their installation? They&nbsp;rose. Ah,
but did the population increase? No. Did the local suicide rate increase
as well? No it went down. Ah.</p>
<p>Stack draws attention to a blog that covers bridge suicides (as well as
media coverage) that may be responsible in part for people choosing
bridge suicide over another method. But he also notes&nbsp;(if we believe
that 'suggestion' has influence on suicide) we should look carefully at
those&nbsp;phones:</p>
<blockquote>
The suggestion thesis holds that the phones, which were installed
with signs alerting suicidal people that they offer a link to help,
will suggest suicide to vulnerable persons. These at-risk
individuals may otherwise not have thought of suicide off the bridge
(Beautrais, 2007; Glatt, 1987). The suggestion hypothesis assumes
that such signs will affect only vulnerable persons at risk of
suicide. It is unlikely that they would impact healthy person.</blockquote>
<p>This last point is important - given we generally hold that
at-risk&nbsp;people can be negatively affected by messaging we should
consider this even when intentions are good. &nbsp;Research on other public
health interventions show we cannot rule out that things done in good
faith to save lives will end up doing net harm.</p>
<p>Klimes-Dougan and Lee (2010) did a study on if suicide prevention
billboards were effective - finding negative as well as positive
effects.&nbsp;They found their&nbsp;billboard (&quot;Prevent Suicide, Treat Depression
– See your Doctor&quot;&nbsp;) was in general good at getting people to believe
that treating depression was a good way to reduce suicide - but also
that their high-risk group tended to end up with a stronger perceived
link between depression and suicide after viewing a billboard. The worry
here is that being too explicit about the connection to depressed people
encourages a railroading of their future down that path. Their TV ad&nbsp;by
contrast didn't have that effect - it&nbsp;used the phrase &quot;it can even lead
to suicide&quot; as an escalation of symptoms of depression, making death one
of several possible options.</p>
<p>The billboard group also ended up with lower help-seeking scores than
the no-information group (A TV advert did better however, public health
campaigns not completely doomed) - directly encouraging people to seek
help might not have the results you hope&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that&nbsp;this is tricky stuff - the words you use
matter.&nbsp;A workshop on public messages for suicide prevention made the
point that broad campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
Broad-based campaigns that are likely to reach multiple audiences
should determine how subgroups of intended populations (or
nontargeted&nbsp;groups of a population) might have different attitudes
about suicide, and may respond differently to messages geared
towards increasing help-seeking behavior (Cauce&nbsp;et al. 2002).</blockquote>
<p>But also that targeted campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
For example, certain American Indian nations have very high rates of
suicide. A campaign via popular Indian radio stations that
highlights the high prevalence may inadvertently normalize suicide
and send the message that such behaviour is expected and is
inevitable. Groups with high rates may get the message that they
have experienced an expected behaviour, and the groups with lower
rates are simply &quot;lagging behind&quot; on what is seen to be inevitable.</blockquote>
<p>You might say they're just being risk adverse - but we have to
acknowledge that letting words loose into the world with the aim of
saving lives is something we seem to know little about. As Beautrais,
Fergusson, Coogan et al (2007) put it:</p>
<blockquote>
Until there is clear evidence that public health messages about
suicide prevent, and do not normalize, suicide, and have no
deleterious effects, the most prudent approach to this issue is not
to include&nbsp;public health messages as part of a suicide prevention
strategy.</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to print crisis lines after newspaper articles in suicide
- which are pretty clearly public health messages that are advocated
frequently&nbsp;as part of a suicide prevention strategy. &nbsp; Stack brings up
Niederkrontenthaler et al (2010) who found that newspaper stories that
printed the phone number of a crisis link seemed associated with an
increase in suicide rates. Now for the&nbsp;record, the authors were more
sceptical of this result than some of their others (they were checking
for so many things and it was one of their least significant results -
although still p &lt; 0.05) - but I can't find anyone else who has
suggested anything to the contrary.&nbsp;Others have done research on if
suicide lines are effective on those they reach e.g Gould et al (2007)
(answer: yes-ish - reduction&nbsp;in pain and hopelessness, but not an
apparent&nbsp;reduction in intent to die), there seems to be very little work
on if the advertisement of the lines is a good idea.</p>
<p>The problem here is the population who is exposed to the advertisement
but who will not be exposed to any&nbsp;positive effect of the helpline - if
this group contains at-risk individuals (which it does) then there is
the prospect of harm.&nbsp;That printing a suicide number could be
negative&nbsp;is consistent with research that billboards can have a harmful
effect and the idea that&nbsp;crisis phones on bridges&nbsp;might not be
universally fantastic.</p>
<p>That certain wordings of these crisis line adverts might be worse than
others is consistent with the idea that suicide contagion is more
powerful when people can identify (and have similarities) with the
subject of the article. If the wording asks you if you identify&nbsp;(&quot;If
you're affected...&quot; - &quot;ooh, am I?&quot;) it might create or intensify a
one-to-one relationship with the subject of the article upon
introspection. This suggests that they shouldn't be viewed as a
corrective or an addendum to the article but part of the text and so
part of any journey of identification.</p>
<p>There clearly isn't enough evidence to say this is something
papers&nbsp;should stop doing - but I think it's something we need to think
more carefully about.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it worrying I can create a hypothesis
based on the same theoretical framework the rest of contagion works on
-&nbsp;and that's consistent with the evidence we do have - that says we are
possibly making things worse. &nbsp;Even if we take&nbsp;Niederkrontenthaler et
al.'s scepticism seriously and move their result to the 'not proven'
column it is deeply concerning that we have almost no&nbsp;positive evidence
we can point to and say &quot;printing the phone number makes the suicide
rate go down&quot;&nbsp;. The idea&nbsp;that the message can never have a negative
effect on non-callers needs to have more thought put into it to justify
the pre-eminence of this advice.</p>
<p>Stack's main point is that crisis phones are not a good substitute for
barriers on bridges (just much cheaper). It's not clear what a more
effective alternative to crisis line ads following suicide stories would
be. I find the fact that most people who suffer from suicidal thoughts
end up not taking their own life a reassuring idea&nbsp;- a disclaimer built
around this idea encourages identification with the living rather than
the dead (and creates a universe larger than the reader and the subject)
could be an approach to explore. But there's no evidence on if this
would be a good approach&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>The final section of my project will deal more generally with how little
evidence there is for a lot of suggested interventions - but I wanted to
share a glimpse into just how much of an unknown doing anything
'positive' in this area can be.</p>

					<p>Notes on Craig Lambert's 'Shadow Work: The Unpaid, Unseen Jobs That Fill
Your Day'. Short: just read the article version - doesn't gain much from
book length.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Lambert's:</p>
<blockquote>
I ADAPTED THIS term from the 1981 book Shadow Work by Austrian
philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich. For Illich, shadow work
included all the unpaid labor done in a wage-based economy, such as
housework. In a subsistence economy, work directly answers the needs
of life: gathering food, growing crops, building shelters, tending
fires. But once money and wages come into play, we encounter a whole
range of tasks that do not address our basic needs. Instead, such
jobs enable us to earn money to buy necessities and, if possible,
luxuries. That is paid work, not our subject here. This book will
identify and describe the unpaid jobs (like commuting) that an
industrial economy spins off for its citizens. Such jobs go
unnoticed because they take place in the wings of the theater while
we are absorbed in the onstage drama of our lives. They exist in the
shadows. Yet they are every bit as real as anything in the
spotlight.</blockquote>
<p>'Adapted' is probably the right word - the critique of self-help is a
bit more fierce in in Illich's original. Illich's definition of shadow
work:</p>
<blockquote>
I call this compliment to wage labour 'shadow work'. It comprises
most housework women do in their homes and apartments, the
activities&nbsp;connected with shopping, most of the homework of students
cramming for exams, the toil&nbsp;expended commuting to and from the job.
It includes the stress of forced consumption, the tedious and
regimented surrender to therapists, compliance&nbsp;with bureaucrats, the
preparation for work to which one is compelled, and many of&nbsp;the
activities usually labelled 'family life'. (p 100)</blockquote>
<p><strong>The false virtue of self-reliance</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Yet, unquestionably, it gives us more to do. Minor tasks like
returning our supermarket shopping carts to a holding pen or busing
our own Starbucks tables have become routine. “Why am I doing this?”
asked Daniel, a philosophy professor in western Massachusetts,
wheeling his empty shopping cart to the collection area. “What
happened to those teenagers who used to collect these things? I kind
of liked watching them push about twenty carts, all nested together,
across the parking lot.”</blockquote>
<p>A sign a few pages in that I'm not necessarily on the same wavelength.
Almost the idea here that tidying up after yourself &nbsp;(and this being
framed as a virtue) is a con so companies don't have to pay people to
clean up after you (and selfish of you because you're denying them
jobs). Possible I'm just socialised into finding that odd but
mechanically, it's only a short jump to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">broken window
fallacy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Mobility</strong></p>
<blockquote>
If these bankers had gone out on hundreds of mortgage appraisals
like my dad did, seeing the actual houses for which they were
lending money and meeting real, live borrowers, would the 2008
banking crisis have happened?</blockquote>
<p>Probably? I think it's hard to argue that&nbsp;<em>no</em> bad decisions were ever
made&nbsp;before people put their own trolleys away?</p>
<blockquote>
But how does an aspiring banker work his way up from the teller’s
window if ATMs and shadow-working customers have displaced tellers?
How does a secretary become the office manager and later an
executive if shadow work eliminates support staff— so there are no
secretaries?</blockquote>
<p>Here we get to interesting questions about social mobility. I'll come
back to this.</p>
<blockquote>
For those without education and skills, these low-level positions
often are their careers. If such jobs vanish, a throng of unemployed
young people will find themselves with little money and too much
spare time. This is a dangerous development in any society. Unrest
and violence throughout the Arab world have erupted from streets
teeming with young men lacking jobs— angry youths who congregate
online through social media. Such mobs can become unruly. In 2003,
the dissolution of the Iraqi army put 400,000 young men out of work
, triggering a bloody insurgency that still continues. In today’s
global village, where citizens network and congregate in political
flashmobs, we cannot risk creating an immense underclass of idle
youth.</blockquote>
<p>De-Ba'athification and self-checkouts seem like extreme companions. Is
the issue of this situation no means of support (money can be exchanged
for goods and services) or spare&nbsp;time (Victorians standardise football
to attempt to control spare&nbsp;time, mixed results)? One&nbsp;is better to
intervene in than the other. Are there better solutions than just
maintain rubbish jobs?</p>
<p><strong>House Work</strong></p>
<p>Illich argues that this unpaid work is a necessary shadow component to
allow wage labour to exist at all and comes back to the unpaid work of
women again and again - &quot;The amount of shadow work laid on a person
today is a much better measure of discrimination than&nbsp;bias on the job&quot;(p
101). &nbsp;Lambert takes this to an extent, discussing medical students
where female doctors in training were found to spend far more time
performing household duties compared to their male counterparts but
pulls back from this at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a place for amateur work. Those domestic chores ground you
in daily realities that sometimes go by the name of life. They
connect you with your home, those rooms and furnishings that serve
you without complaint. They bond you to your family, because the
shadow work of housekeeping can be a tangible form of love. The fact
that my mom cooked our meals, washed our clothes, and hung them on a
clothesline to dry—even in winter— and kept our home clean and
orderly, meant so much to my father, sister, brother, and me. Mom
wanted us to have the conditions for a healthy and happy life.
Keeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow work. When
a paid cook, laundress, nanny, or maid does household tasks, the
jobs may be executed very well, but they’re done for a salary, not
from love of family. Inevitably, the work of servants has a
different feeling.</blockquote>
<p>Lambert's version of &quot;Shadow Work&quot; is noticeable less biting than
Illich's. If we accept that supermarkets tricking us with 'self
reliance' to do our own checkout is promoting virtue as a con, it's hard
to see how &quot;[k]eeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow
work&quot; is any less so. Shadow work that dents the prospects of men like
his father to work up the ladder is bad, shadow work by women that
enabled his father the time to do that is good. I don't mind a
definition of shadow work where it &quot;just is&quot; rather than being bad
(giving free labour) or good (control and privacy) &nbsp;- but when so much
of the tone of the book is&nbsp;&quot;You didn't realise you were doing other
people's jobs for them you sucker&quot; bits like this stick out.</p>
<p><strong>Internships</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The upshot is an army of young people doing full-time shadow work
for months or even years, trying to break into the job market as
unpaid trainees.</blockquote>
<p>Say there's a good book about that...</p>
<blockquote>
The internship juggernaut represents a massive, widespread,
institutionalized form of shadow work. The 2011 exposé Intern
Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New
Economy, by Ross Perlin, offers a biting critique of the internship
explosion.</blockquote>
<p>Which Lambert has also read, so just go read that. Accept these are
related problems&nbsp;but&nbsp;has to be a distinction between consumers taking on
the work of the companies they buy from (doing work that reduces costs
for free) and doing a recognisable job for free (internships). Is a
definition of shadow work that encompasses both actually useful?</p>
<p><strong>Servants and Service</strong></p>
<blockquote>
In the United States, we feel a profound ambivalence about receiving
personal service. In this respect, America differs from the Old
World, where monarchs ruled for centuries. Europeans are accustomed
to royalty, nobility, and aristocracies, settled in their palaces
and great mansions with domestic servants. Indeed, hereditary
monarchs still sit on thrones in Britain, Spain, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Europe has long lived
with an entrenched class structure that included a servant class
waiting on their “betters.” Consequently, Old World cultures feel a
degree of comfort with personal service.</blockquote>
<p>This is at best simplistic. Lucy Lethbridge's&nbsp;<em>'Servants: A Downstairs
View of Twentieth-century Britain</em>' has an excellent running thread on
the aristocracy slowly learning to do things themselves. For a bit more
historical background on how changes in available labour and funds led
the upper-class to &quot;shadow-work&quot; read that (although &quot;Hey what were the
rich up to?&quot; is not the point of the book).&nbsp;Small snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
Concessions were made towards slightly smaller numbers of household
staff but also to a generation that had begun to enjoy some
independence and was not quite as deficient in practical skills as
its parents’ generation had been. Breakfasts in grand houses, for
example, became increasingly self-service, the dishes arranged on
the sideboard</blockquote>
<p>Bringing the historical picture into it is exactly what a book on
&quot;shadow work&quot; should do (and what Illich does at length with the rise of
wage labour). Is &quot;Removing entry level work reduces social mobility&quot;
just a modern variation of &quot;but how will people become butlers if there
are less entry level servant jobs?&quot; If not, why not? What lessons does
the decline of servants have for the decline of a service-economy?</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;Lambert's assertion that tipping is an Americanism resulting from
an unease to personal service is obviously&nbsp;ahistorical. It's not only a
European import but was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12tipping-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp">resisted by
Americans</a>
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>This section of the book is pretty clearly padding to reach the word
limit, but by extending the concept to dating it completely falls apart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, people met dating partners through family and
friends, at work, or through hobbies and social events. Today,
various businesses also facilitate linking up. Professional
matchmakers introduce their clients for a fee. Printed or online
personal ads, singles groups and events (not just drinking and
dancing but singles yoga classes, cycling trips, and gardening
clubs), and “speed dating” help make connections. The fact that
these businesses exist testifies that traditional ways of meeting
are no longer getting the job done.</p>
<p>[...]Dating-site questionnaires probe views and preferences to build
personality profiles. The data archive that shadow-working customers
create for free becomes (like Facebook’s content) a valuable capital
asset that the sites can monetize. In one sense, providing this data
is just the obvious ante: You have to pony up information to play
the game. On the other hand, it’s a task that does not arise when
people meet via real social networks rather than virtual ones. In
this way it qualifies as shadow work, as the dating site puts it in
place.</p>
<p>[...]Late-night OkCupid work can mean sleeping less and finding
yourself increasingly fatigued by the shadow work of dating.
“Typically I would send messages back and forth via the site three
times before one of us would suggest exchanging cell phone numbers
to arrange a meeting,” Rachel says. “Once I had someone’s number I
would probably exchange another three text messages to decide on a
place and time and confirm meeting up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really, really pushing it. If &quot;talking to people&quot; is shadow-work
literally anything that involves effort is now shadow-work. Is this
unpaid work that makes wage labour possible? Is it even self-servicing
what used to be done by wage labour? If we accept that amateur labour
(doing work that others would be paid for) counts as shadow-work, then
people match-making their friends is shadow-work because they're doing
work that people are paying online sites to do.&nbsp;The concept as Lambert
uses it means absolutely nothing.</p>

					<p>A 2000 Paul Krugman
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html">article</a>&nbsp;arguing
the problems of rent control was going round twitter yesterday in
response to Miliband rent control proposals in the UK. Ignoring the fact
the Miliband's rent control is a controlled-rise system rather the the
traditional set-up Krugman attacks, anyone who finds his San Francisco
example scary doesn't really understand the current problems in the
housing market:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side, consider an article that appeared in yesterday's
New York Times, ''In San Francisco, Renters Are Supplicants.'' It
was an interesting piece, with its tales of would-be renters
spending months pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate
applicants arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress
the landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something
crucial missing -- specifically, two words I knew had to be part of
the story.</p>
<p>Not that I have any special knowledge about San Francisco's housing
market -- in fact, as of yesterday morning I didn't know a thing
about it. But it was immediately obvious from the story what was
going on. To an economist, or for that matter a freshman who has
taken Economics 101, everything about that story fairly screamed
those two words -- which are, of course, ''rent control.''</p>
<p>After all, the sort of landlord behavior described in the article --
demanding that prospective tenants supply resumes and credit
reports, that they dress nicely and act enthusiastic -- <strong>doesn't
happen in uncontrolled housing markets</strong> [emphasis&nbsp;mine]. Landlords
don't want groveling -- they would rather have money. In
uncontrolled markets the question of who gets an apartment is
settled quickly by the question of who is able and willing to pay
the most. And so I had no doubts about what I would find after a bit
of checking -- namely, that San Francisco is a city where a
technology-fueled housing boom has collided with a draconian
rent-control law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to be too scared by this doomsday vision of prospective
tenants at the mercy of strange landlord demands because this is pretty
close to what I've actually experienced. I've <a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/invasive-referencing/">written about it
before</a>
but one place we almost moved the landlord, despite the fact the letting
agent would do a reference check, demanded to see bank statements and
have a meeting with us before accepting our offer. &nbsp;This wasn't a
friendly&nbsp;meeting, it was&nbsp;an aggressive &quot;how do I know you won't leave
early&quot;, &quot;how stable are your jobs&quot;, &quot;you don't have friends and parties
right&quot; meeting.&nbsp;You got the impression quickly he was of the &quot;unexpected
visit&quot; school of bad landlords and having come from another bad landlord
situation we got the deposit back and moved into another place. Here we
spent the next year dealing with mould, rats, mice and cockroaches, but
the choice&nbsp;we made was absolutely the right one. That would not have
been a good landlord to have.</p>
<p>This can't be dismissed as &quot;just one creep&quot;.&nbsp;Looking at bank statements
is a practice defended on landlord forums because of the &quot;risk&quot;
landlords take by being landlords.&nbsp;Another place wasn't even interested
in renting a two double-bedroom place to a group of three because they
were looking for &quot;professionals&quot; rather than people who knew each other
- essentially they wanted people with few connections who would treat
the place as a dormitory&nbsp;rather than a place to be lived or socialised
in&nbsp;(with the &quot;risks&quot; that might entail).</p>
<p>But London doesn't have rent control - if the landlord had so many
offers that they could afford to be picky why don't they just raise the
price? Don't they just want money? The way to make sense of this is&nbsp;that
the wrong people operate the private rental sector. In 2010 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf">a private
landlord&nbsp;survey</a>
found that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eighty-nine per cent of landlords were private individual landlords
responsible for 71% of all private rented dwellings, with a further
5% of landlords being company landlords responsible for 15% of
dwellings.</li>
<li>More than three quarters (78%) of all landlords only owned a single
dwelling for rent, with only 8% of landlords stating they were full
time landlords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale landlords are the major player in the rental sector and
they're not always going to be good capitalists. The ones that act like
the above&nbsp;are risk-adverse and want their investment bothering them as
little as possible.&nbsp;If the amount of money you are willing to accept to
balance the greater perceived risk is greater&nbsp;than the difference
between the price where you have one buyer and and the price where you
have enough choice to chose less risky tenants, you will charge less
than you can and screen. &nbsp;People who will put up with this before even
moving in are likely to be less troublesome, less likely to make demands
of work that cost money/require attention, less likely to understand
their legal situation, etc. This is a better and more comfortable
position for the investor-landlord.&nbsp;The rate of return&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996">is still
ridiculous</a>&nbsp;regardless.</p>
<p>When people say that rent control means that properties&nbsp;won't be
maintained and landlords will have invasive and offensive tests of
potential tenants I'm not scared of rent control - I'm scared people
don't seem to understand the full extent of the problem. We clearly&nbsp;do
not live&nbsp;a housing market where tenants are only discriminated against
on the size of the wallets - when your uncontrolled situation is pretty
close to the controlled bogeyman something has gone very wrong.</p>
