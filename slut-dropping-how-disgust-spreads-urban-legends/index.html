					<p>Yesterday's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism
Project</a>&nbsp;column introduced the
internet to what is highly likely to be a new urban legend: Slut
dropping. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">The full story
goes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
He described a group of excited male first-years who told him about
a new trend: “slut dropping”. The process, they explained, involves
driving around town with friends in the early hours of the morning
and offering a lift home to a young woman they deem a “slut”
(usually a woman in a “post-club state”). After asking her address,
they drive as fast and as far as possible in the opposite direction
before forcing the woman out of the car and using a camera to film
her “standing by the side of the road as they drive away”.&nbsp; Some of
the images find their way onto the internet, part of a disturbing
new trend of ‘slut-shaming’. On one occasion, the first-year added,
it had taken the girl eight hours to get home. When asked how he
knew, he explained that they were ‘friends’ on Facebook.</blockquote>
<p>There are obvious reasons to be suspicious of this: it's incredibly
elaborate and our source is 'people who our source talked to who heard
it off someone on facebook'. All urban legends seem to happen at that
friend of friend remove, both&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;and distant. Another interesting
aspect is &nbsp;'offering a lift home' because the story now involves the
woman making a choice. Urban legends are the oldest form of education -
telling you what choices and decisions are good or bad. This&nbsp;is why
urban legends are often structured exactly like horror stories, with
shared origins in scary stories told to teach the young lessons. &nbsp;It's
not enough that horrible things happen to you, you have to have made
choices that lead to this - as Cabin in the Woods put it&nbsp;&quot;if they don’t
transgress, they can’t be punished”.</p>
<p>Brunvard argues that urban legends &quot;often&nbsp;depict&nbsp;a clash between modern
conditions and some aspect of a traditional life-style&quot;[1. Brunvard, Jan
Harold (1981), The Vanishing Hitchhiker, New York: Norton, p. 18&nbsp;] and
here the conflict is with the idea of the modern, sexually liberated
woman. In this case the woman has committed three sins, looking like a
&quot;slut&quot;, walking home alone in the early hours and accepting a lift in a
stranger's car.&nbsp;That an urban legend obeys the rule of three isn't a
huge surprise - it's a storytelling rule for a reason, and urban legends
like all good memes will mutate till they find their most
attractive-to-spread form. We're invited to feel disgust that there are
people out there who would do this, which&nbsp;fascinatingly&nbsp;is the emotion
the most successful urban legends will pull on.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Heath_Emotional_Selection.pdf">Heath, Bell and
Sternberg
argue</a>&nbsp;(p
32)&nbsp;that urban legends aren't just selected on&nbsp;informational &nbsp;content,
but emotional content and will mutate to their most disgusting form:</p>
<blockquote>
In general, the studies provide converging evidence for emotional
selection. Study 1 showed that, controlling for informational
aspects of truth and usefulness, people were more willing to pass
along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 manipulated
levels of disgust, and showed that people preferred to pass along
the versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3
showed that legends could be reliably coded for individual story
motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated
substance). It also showed that the number of motifs affected
popularity; legends that contained more disgust motifs were more
likely to be passed along and were distributed more widely on web
sites that specialize in contemporary legends. The results of Study
3 are particularly interesting because they suggest that emotional
selection may alter the distribution of memes in the social
environment.</blockquote>
<p>There are clues as to what earlier versions of this legend may have
looked like: they don't just drop women off in the middle of nowhere -
they take pictures, they put it on&nbsp;Facebook! And what happens next? The
story spreads - look at the words used to describe 'slut dropping' in
follow-ups:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/09/slut-dropping-becomes-dis_n_1952553.html">Huffington Post
headline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;'Slut Dropping' Becomes Disturbing Trend In England&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Today, let me introduce you to a practice known as &quot;slut-dropping.&quot;
Apparently it's all the rage in the UK, and I'm shocked that it
hasn't caught on Stateside, since this sounds right up a lot of
jerks' alleys.</blockquote>
<p>Here the meme has mutated again - it's not just a single
horrible&nbsp;incident, it's a trend, it has a <em>name</em>, it's happening
everywhere! We're no longer at the mercy of a depraved few, but exist in
a depraved society where this happens all the time. I don't know about
you, but that sounds pretty disgusting and spreadable.</p>
<p>Throughout this post I've been pretty dismissive of the idea that this
is a real thing because it has so many traits of an urban legend that
it'd be a surprise if it wasn't - there is of course
the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;that this happened somewhere at least once and mutated
into the legend it has now become. However as described 'slut dropping'
pretty much amounts to abduction and police records in the area in
question (where is that again?) could be a help for those looking to
confirm the story (though of course lack of records doesn't necessarily
disprove it) - it'll be interesting to see if anyone comes up with
anything.</p>
<p>As urban legends are always mutating to get around your defences and
spread themselves it's hard to blame anyone too much for giving this one
a kickstart but as&nbsp;Bates put that story quite early on, that's where a
lot of the attention is while the general point and the other examples
given are really worthy of a bit more attention. Go read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">the rest of
that
article</a>
again, we don't need&nbsp;mythical&nbsp;cars dropping women off in the middle of
nowhere for a lot to be wrong here.</p>
