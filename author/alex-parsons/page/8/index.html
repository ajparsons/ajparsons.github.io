                </h2>
				Nov 11, 2011
                
				
					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trainorphans/291910257/"><img alt="ballot" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/112/291910257_043c2e8f2e_m.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-plan-to-take-charge-of-scottish-independence-vote-6260514.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.</p>
<p>Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &quot;independence lite&quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.</p>
<p>There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Kellner of YouGov has a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">good run
down</a>
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html">they're leaving a space open for it to
return</a>,
and ERS Scotland<a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases">is advocating a different
form</a> of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.</p>
<p>One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;independence?</p>
<p>One answer would be that the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.</p>
<p>There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&nbsp;information&nbsp;on if people would
prefer&nbsp;independence&nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.</p>
<p>If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Would you like a change to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Would you prefer&nbsp;independence or devo-max?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.</p>
<p>“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.</p>
<p>From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&nbsp;political&nbsp;stitch-up in&nbsp;Westminster).&nbsp;This leaves either&nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Johannhari-150x150.jpg" />The Independent has finished it's investigation into the
Johann Hari saga and while&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html">Hari has
apologised</a>,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:</p>
<blockquote>
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.<strong>(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university</strong>.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&nbsp;seems to suggest that &quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&nbsp;acquainted - as <a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html">Jeremy Duns
points
out</a>,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx"><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/binladen-300x247.png" /></a>A colouring book setting out to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx">explain 9/11 to
kids</a>
is obviously walking a mine field of every variety, but looking at the
site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.</blockquote>
<p>Which might be taking small liberties with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html">original
intent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.</blockquote>
<p>Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&quot; Bell said. &quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview
with Bell himself.</p>

<div><p><strong>|image0|****Assorted 'Let’s Kill Hitler' thoughts:****</strong></p>
</div><div><ul class="simple">
<li>The one thing you can say about Moffat stories is that they are
bursting with ideas, sometimes they don’t mesh well (a problem I have
with the Library two-parter) but when it works the show is just alive
with creative energy. This week we had: many, many details of River
Song’s increasingly temporally confused backstory - the crew of the
Enterprise manning the T-1000 with polite and deadly robot jellyfish,
travelling through time, setting right what once went wrong with
horrible horrible torture - &nbsp;a mysterious religious order devoted to
answering the final question and ending the universe - &nbsp;extractor
fans! This had it all.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.abyssandapex.com/200710-wikihistory.html">Everyone kills Hitler on their first
trip</a>.</li>
<li>Clearly the crew of the Justice Vehicle are pretty awful people. Most
stories about time travellers who try to kill Hitler give them a
motive of trying to prevent the wrongs of the past (and then learn
important lessons about knock-on effects), the ‘travel to the very
last moment of their life and torture them’ approach is more
respectful of the timeline but also more morally reprehensible. It
has no deterrent effect, in fact it’s vital no one knows about them
because telling people about it would effect the timeline - what it
comes down to is people in the far future judging your life according
to criteria you’re not aware of and punishing you in a way that’s
really only to the benefit of their bloodlust. Hitler I imagine we
can all agree belongs on the shit list, but if Churchill (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html">not
universally a wonderful
person</a>)
had a visitor to his deathbed people might be more split.</li>
<li>Time travellers creating an afterlife because God let us down by not
existing is also dipped into briefly in the Baxter and Clarke novel
‘<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days">The Light of Other
Days</a>’,
where towards the end the perfection of time-traversing wormholes
allows the far future to download and recreate the brain at the
moment of death. Sufficiently advanced technology indeed.</li>
<li>Questions that cause the universe to end have a good pedigree. While
the obvious association of an ultimate question given Adams’ Who
connection is to Hitchhikers, what this made me think more of more
are two classic short stories, Clarke’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html">The Nine Billion Names of
God</a>’
and Asimov’s ‘<a class="reference external" href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last
Question</a>’. In ‘The
Nine Billion’ a computer is built to systematically list all the
possible names of God in the belief that when this happens the
purpose of the universe will be fulfilled and it will promptly shut
up shop - the final question is answered and silence will fall
(coincidentally, the stars going out now qualifies as a recurring
thing in New Who). In ‘The Last Question’ successive generations from
the near-present to the heat-death ask a question of the increasingly
sophisticated machines they’ve created, a question that’s at first an
intellectual curiosity and then gradually the last and only relevant
question: “Can entropy be reversed?”. While interesting I don’t think
this is any use for plot guessing purposes, I’m just hoping for
something better than “Doctor Who?” (Although there would be
something very Adamish in an inter-temporal war and attempted
universe-cide resulting from a very badly misunderstood knock knock
joke.)</li>
<li>As Mels grows up alongside with her parents, Moffat seems to be
pushing the idea that effectively they did raise her anyway and so
this solves the problem of how the show can tonally have Amy and Rory
having adventures not related to getting their stolen child back. I’m
willing to accept this-ish,but clearly Rory and Amy would be better
parents to a child now then they would have been when they themselves
were children. Given Mels seems to have a slightly rocky life and
most of what they know about River’s later life is that she’s
imprisoned in the Stormcage (which really in terms of actually
keeping people in is almost as bad as Arkham), it’d be easy for them
to imagine that Melody would have had a much better life if they’d
properly had the chance to raise her. It's a bit of a serious downer
and I’m curious to see if the show has any further interest in
addressing it.</li>
<li>Is the Doctor just dressing to go out in style, or does the outfit
change signify like in ‘Flesh and Stone’ that there’s a bit of story
missing that might appear later on? As ever, there is insufficient
data for a meaningful answer.</li>

                </h2>
				Aug 29, 2011
                
				
					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/west-wing.jpg" />I've just finished Andrew Rawnsley's&nbsp;<em>`The End of the
Party &lt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Party-Andrew-Rawnsley/dp/0670918512&gt;`__</em>&nbsp;and
in the period when Brown thought a Lib-Lab coalition was a possibility
there's this brief anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
'He felt his legacy could be a progressive coalition. Brown imagined
a final six months at Number 10 as the sort of benign, presidential
'father of the nation' figure he had often dreamed of being. Talking
to Tom Fletcher that evening, Brown said: &quot;If we somehow pull this
off, you'll find I'll turn into President Bartlet.'&quot;</blockquote>
<p>That Brown with his long-standing affinity for America would reach for
<em>The West Wing</em>&nbsp;as a model for a national leader perhaps isn't that
surprising but the infulence of the show is a recurring presence in
British politics,&nbsp;from rumours that George Osbourne was basing a No. 10
floor plan around the West Wing to a'West Wing plot' &nbsp;leading to a
government defeat and, more recently,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jul/12/edmiliband-davidcameron">Ed Miliband's
advisors</a>&nbsp;ending
meetings declaring '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8">Let Bartlet be
Bartlet</a>'. Biblical
allusions might now past us by, but&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqgLr5A0-m0">everyone knows who Josh
is</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://tomcharris.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/a-british-west-wing-beyond-our-abilities/">Tom
Harris</a>
takes the lack of a British West Wing with an optimistic and positive
portrayal of&nbsp;politicians partly as a failure of the &nbsp;nation's&nbsp;appetite
(which he sees as being incapable of digesting a show that earnest if
the accents were closer to home), but also the&nbsp;nation's writers - unable
to write politicians&nbsp;as anything other than cynical or corrupt. I think
this oversells the case, British television may not have produced the
West Wing but American television only&nbsp;barely&nbsp;did, producing it just
once and common portrayals of&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;in the US often skew closer to
the cynical. Not to say there's nothing to the idea of national tastes
but I think that there are specific structural problems with crafting&nbsp;a
positive show about the machinery of government that make it easier
to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;in the US than the UK. A clue as to why is&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/12/once-and-future-president.html">Abigail
Nussbaum's
take</a>&nbsp;that
the West Wing is essentially a show&nbsp;about the royal court of a more
politically acceptable medieval monarchy. Interestingly she points out
one of the most obvious example of this interpretation is from the same
episode that Miliband's advisors are drawing from, &quot;Let Bartlet be
Bartlet&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
Leo turns to each of the staff as they recite &quot;I serve at the
pleasure of &nbsp;the President of the United States.&quot; He isn't leading a
pep rally; he's reminding them of their oaths of fealty, and
reminding Bartlet, who is standing just outside the room, of the
courage and devotion of the men and women he commands.</blockquote>
<p>Put in this context it's quite clear why something with the tone of the
West Wing would be quite hard to achieve in the UK - while the US
political system sanitised the trappings of monarchy, the UK instead
moved power into different arenas. The characters in the West Wing are
all attempting to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;the agenda of one man while also trying to
shape that agenda - the show's universe revolves around the President
and his staff's loyalty to him. &nbsp;While the British Prime Minister is
potentially more powerful, they are not the only one in the room who
matters, their power base &nbsp;is only one among many. In the Parliamentary
system many of the key positions of government are staffed by MPs&nbsp;with
their own electoral mandate and their own overlapping and shared (but
also unique) agendas. Prime Ministers live with the constant knowledge
that the party as much as the electorate will be the eventual decider of
their fate. If a British Bartlet had concealed their MS, their decision
to seek a second term would be likely to be far less of a personal
decision.</p>
<p>Conflict is the bread and butter of drama and while the
check-and-balance heavy US system is filled with potential external
opponents for the team (it's not a coincidence that there's a Republican
Congress for the entire run) meaning that while there are conflicts
within the team, they remain low key and amicable. For a UK government
with a majority there are few effectual external opponents - the primary
antagonisms are then within the party, within the government and within
the main cast.&nbsp;The West Wing transplanted to the New Labour era would
have the PM with the ability to do pretty much anything he wanted,
unless it was blocked by the second-billed character, a long-term friend
turned antagonist. Bartlet's troubled relationship with his Vice
President is ultimately harmless because the Vice Presidency isn't
necessarily&nbsp;powerful (it's not a surprise that Iannucci's US version
of&nbsp;<em>The Thick Of It</em>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a314997/armando-iannuccis-veep-picked-up-by-hbo.html">is based around the
VP</a>),
the nearest analogy would be if Bartlet and Leo were at each other's
throats - it would be very hard for for the West Wing to be an
optimistic show in this context.</p>
<p>Because the institution of the Prime Minster is relatively flexible,
depending on the circumstances of their election and the style of the
leader (the Major era very different from Blair, very different to
Cameron, etc)&nbsp;there's no&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;to the status of the Presidency
(except, of course, the Monarchy). The positive feelings and
glorification of the&nbsp;institution's&nbsp;history as well as the status-quo
bias of the US policy process justifies a kind of mythic stasis - &nbsp;big
projects of the staff like Sam's&nbsp;Manhattan&nbsp;project for beating cancer,
Josh and Toby's tax-deductible&nbsp;tuition are ultimately stories&nbsp;about&nbsp;why
these things didn't happen.&nbsp;There are battles, some of which are won and
some of which aren't, but the status quo of the West Wing mostly remains
the same - there have always been kings and knights on horses defending
the realm and there always will be, they will be fighting about gun
control, gay rights, religion in government, today and tomorrow, and
tomorrow and tomorrow. That the characters take sides in this eternal
conflict without scoring any lasting&nbsp;successes&nbsp;(this only really applies
to the Sorkin era, once he leaves they quickly bring peace to the Middle
East) is arguably realistic in the context of a&nbsp;political&nbsp;system where
paralysis is envisioned as a positive feature and so even failure can
glorify the system. The ability of a British government to achieve
change (and the expectation that they will which stigmatizes&nbsp;failure)
combined with a lack of a long-term, static institution of the Prime
Minister would make it difficult for a British West Wing to find the
same amicable atmosphere where characters sit around and talk about
timeless&nbsp;issues in a consequence-free way.</p>
<p>While none of this completely rules out the possibility of a optimistic
and earnest show about British politics (I've been trying to get hold of
the 'Number 10' Radio 4 plays to see if they pull it off), it does make
it easier to understand why&nbsp;The West Wing has only happened once in the
US and not at all in the UK.&nbsp;The 'royal court' take on the West Wing
would actually suggest we've had several films in the previous decade
that had optimistic and positive portrayals of the British system, they
were just all about the monarchy.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidmichaelshanks/2449510845/"><img alt="Half Mast" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2044/2449510845_85e1c422f3.jpg" /></a>It's inevitable with breaking stories that the media is
going to call some things wrong, what's more concerning is that it tends
to do this in ways that are revealing of deeper problems. Immediately
after the attacks in Norway the commentariat's initial reaction was to
blame it on Islamic terrorism, which is understandable because it is
after all the sexiest kind of terrorism. That the information that the
majority of terrorist attacks in Europe are <a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/25/missing_the_real_warning_signs">committed by home grown
groups</a>
is easily found on the internet is neither here nor there - as Charlie
Brooker <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/24/charlie-brooker-norway-mass-killings">put
it</a>,
the media coverage was less experts than guessers and they &quot;were
terrible, like toddlers hypothesising how a helicopter works.&quot;</p>
<p>The news media is rarely humbled or apologetic when they get things
wrong but simply moves on to being wrong about something else, often in
the same story. The next step here is the assertion with little proof,
that Anders Breivik is insane. It might well turn out that he is, but in
the meantime not only does this reinforce the harmful stereotype
connecting mental health issues with violence, it's also a bit
convenient because irrational people can't be expected to be reacting to
incentives and so it absolves anyone else of responsibility in creating
an environment where he felt that terrorism was a good idea. It's not
clear to me that his actions are inherently irrational, it's very
apparently a politically motivated crime with the express purpose of a)
harming 'the enemy' and b) gaining him and his beliefs exposure. Given
the well-established pattern of how the world's media cover shootings, b
was at least was a slam dunk. The Norwegian court in closing the hearing
was operating under the strange principle that it shouldn't be a
complacent part of a mass murderer's pre-meditated promotion strategy,
something that media outlets have always had much more trouble doing.
His (I'm assuming pre-prepared) image plastered websites and newspapers
for days, the 24 news channels didn't stop for speculation and
examination of his motives, and the attack spurred a series of '<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">He's
obviously an awful person, but he's not
wrong</a>'
articles. It's not the start of the revolution he hoped for but as a
political act, it was far from inconsequential. Dismissing him as simply
a 'maniac' ignores the fact that the reaction of the media to massacres
like these actually acts as a powerful incentive to commit them.</p>
<p>On the other side of the blame game, insanity neatly helps those who
occupy relatively mainstream spaces in society and have spent years fear
mongering about Islam pending takeover of Europe to create a comfortable
distance between themselves and Breivik. I'm going to pick on Tim
Stanley's <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100098575/whatever-liberal-commentators-say-the-tea-party-does-not-bear-responsibility-for-anders-breivik/">Telegraph
post</a>
for being well ahead of the curve on this one. Despite Breivik obvious
political motivations (like, he wrote them down) Stanley insists that
these are the actions of a 'lone psychopath', and that any connection
between his actions and his claimed motivations are entirely
coincidental. His statement that &quot;[t]he kind of person who can
systematically shoot and kill that many people is mentally ill or
possessed by demons&quot; is helpful, because here 'mental illness' is
performing exactly the same role that blaming things on demons does, a
scapegoat that absolves us of responsibility[1. Stanley's attempt to
dismiss his strawman notion that 'the left' thinks 'the right' is
responsible for all anti-Islamic violence by equating it with the
absurdity of the idea that 'the left' must be responsible for all
anti-Christian violence is especially cruel given that many Christians
would consider themselves to be on the left, and just the other year
churchgoers in Tennessee were gunned down by a man with a hatred of
liberals <a class="reference external" href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/knoxville-church-shooters-manifesto">who
name-checked</a>
several of the same people as Breivik. Also despite what he says links
between Tea&nbsp;Party groups and white supremacists are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/pages/tea-party-report">alive and
credible</a>.]. Somehow
these 'lone wolves' get the idea that the world would be a better place
without certain groups and while maybe they're just picking ideas out of
the aether, it is at least slightly possible that they are aided to
these positions by reading the rhetoric of the people they say they're
reading. While with the media platform issue there are at least clear
steps that could be taken to reduce the problem, I'm not exactly sure
what the solution is here. I do think there's some sort of moral duty
incumbent on people not to make their careers spreading xenophobia and
hate, but that's less because people might go out and shoot people and
more because it's a generally shit thing to do. Melanie Phillips'
response to finding two of her articles within his manifesto <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/25/norway-melanie-phillips-hits-back">is
revealing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;The supposed beliefs of Norway massacre's perpetrator has got the
left in general wetting itself in delirium at this apparently
heaven-sent opportunity to take down those who fight for life,
liberty and western civilisation against those who would destroy
it.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I have vague sympathy here because Philips isn't actively fermenting
armed revolution but to me safeguarding western civilisation is a cause
that's probably worth killing for. If you're telling people the stakes
are <em>that</em> high, <a class="reference external" href="http://flyingrodent.blogspot.com/2011/07/worlds-first-anti-jihadist-mass.html">can you really claim distance when people take you
seriously</a>?
If having been repeatedly told by authority figures that your cause is
literally the defence of western civilisation, you find yourself unable
to effect the mainstream political process but know that you'll be given
a world-wide platform if you commit a horrific act, why wouldn't it be
rational to put your manifesto on the internet and go kill a bunch of
kids? If the idea of 'killing innocents so more can be saved' is
inherently crazy then there's a lot of foreign policy we need to
revisit, and if killing full stop is a sign of deranged mind it's in
even bigger trouble.</p>
<p>My point here is that you don't have to be crazy to be an extremist and
you don't have to be crazy to kill people, either might be immoral but
by themselves do not suggest anything about someone's sanity. It might
yet turn out that Breivik is insane (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-is-insane-says-his-lawyer-2326232.html">his lawyer thinks he
is</a>,
let's wait for the doctors) but should that happen it doesn't
retrospectively improve the current rhetoric any more than if the attack
had been carried out by al-Qaeda it would have made the initial coverage
any less terrible - it simply means that that particular guess was
correct and it's one rooted in prejudices and self-interest rather than
reality.</p>
