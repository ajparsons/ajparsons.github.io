					<p>Tolkien started a sequel to Lord of the Rings, but decided it wasn't worth the effort:</p>
<p>&gt; I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the Downfall, but it proved both sinister and depressing. Since we are dealing with Men it is inevitable that we should be concerned with the most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety with good. So that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and prosperity, would become discontented and restless — while the dynasts descended from Aragorn would become just kings and governors — like Denethor or worse. I found that even so early there was an outcrop of revolutionary plots, about a centre of secret Satanistic religion; while Gondorian boys were playing at being Orcs and going around doing damage. I could have written a ‘thriller’ about the plot and its discovery and overthrow — but it would have been just that. Not worth doing.</p>
<p>Gerry Canavan 'points out&lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.salon.com/2015/12/24/from_a_new_hope_to_no_hope_at_all_star_wars_tolkien_and_the_sinister_and_depressing_reality_of_expanded_universes/">http://www.salon.com/2015/12/24/from_a_new_hope_to_no_hope_at_all_star_wars_tolkien_and_the_sinister_and_depressing_reality_of_expanded_universes/</a>&gt;'_ this limit is inherent in Tolkien's world and also applies to the new Star Wars universe:</p>
<p>&gt;I taught The Silmarillion this semester after having tried and failed to read it as a child, and I think it would certainly be fair to call it “depressing.” What looks, in The Lord of the Rings, like a fairy-tale about how good and decent folk are able to do the impossible and defeat evil (with just a little bit of help from the divine, here and there) becomes in The Silmarillion and The New Shadow and Tolkien’s pseudo-theological commentary only the briefest, most temporary respite from a nightmare history in which things always turn out wrong, millennia after millennia after millennia.</p>
<p>&gt; [...] I’ve been thinking about The New Shadow since it became clear that The Force Awakens would be borrowing from the Expanded Universe the notion that the Battle of Endor at the end of Return of the Jedi did not mark a full or permanent victory for the Rebel Alliance. The Force Awakens is The New Shadow, sinister and depressing, except they decided to go ahead and do it anyway.</p>
<p>This is the problem with ongoing universes. Victories Won must be Lost. Or what is this story about?</p>
<p>In The Force Awakens behind the confusion of &quot;Wait, so who are the Resistance? Are they the same thing as the Republic? Do we need a map?&quot; is an even more basic confusion - Didn't we win? Why is all this even happening?</p>
<p>In the original Star Wars expanded universe Chewbacca dies to show the stakes are real. That continuity has been wiped away. Nothing happier has taken its place.</p>
<p>The Star Trek novel continuations don't do much better. The Borg show up and kill fictional trillions. Characters that we know, that we thought had had their happy endings, spend books wandering around being sad about all they'd lost. And of course they should be upset about genocide! But genocide to &quot;shake up&quot; the universe a bit is becoming repetitive. To tell new stories when we've already won we must first make things worse.</p>
<p>Heroes can't be left alone in their happy endings. They must always be called out of retirement - for one last (probably fatal) time, or have the whole ending undone so they can have many more adventures. If we can never say goodbye to characters all endings will be sad.</p>
<p>Even if a hero dies nobly and purposefully, commercially viable fantasy universes don't let them stay that way. See season 6 of Buffy. See sixty years of Marvel.</p>
<p>In the Assassin's Creed games you're dropped in history and have to dismantle the power structure of an evil conspiracy - in the knowledge that by the present day all your progress has been undone. And then in the next game you do it all again.</p>
<p>Universes where characters are doomed to do the same thing, over and over and over, are fundamentally sad places. The opening of Ecclesiastes is a lament. But that lament has become the foundation of modern empires.</p>
<p>The Marvelfication of cinema will end when it simply becomes too sad.</p>
