					<p>An
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2015/01/if-you-believe-trans-lives-matter-dont-share-leelah-alcorns-suicide-note-social">article</a>&nbsp;went
up on The New Statesman today arguing&nbsp;that people sharing the suicide
note of a trans-person were actually endangering the very people they
were trying to raise awareness of. This is&nbsp;based on The Samaritans
guidelines&nbsp;that journalists should&nbsp;not print the content of suicide
notes because of the idea of 'suicide contagion' - arguing that
including details of suicide notes can make it more likely people will
try and emulate the note's author.</p>
<p>My opinion of the Samaritan’s guidelines is
they offer&nbsp;good generalised advice that should be read and often
followed. That said, specific guidance is often detached from supporting
evidence and shouldn't be used as an authority to beat people with.
There are circumstances where blindly following guidance has the
potential to do harm and I think this is one of them.</p>
<p>To understand why the contagious understanding of the suicide note is a
bit narrow we need to know a bit more history. I go into this in far
more detail in the finished piece but my basic premise is that over the
last few centuries’ media coverage of suicide played a significant part
in making us a better, kinder&nbsp;society&nbsp;more understanding of
those&nbsp;amongst us most in pain.</p>
<p>To quickly summarise historian Michael MacDonald’s argument [1] -
newspapers secularised suicide by making it a mundane fact of life. The
syndication of suicide stories made the fact of suicide a constant
low-level noise as opposed to something that would happen in smaller
communities incredibly infrequently. From stories of the devil stalking
the earth and taking lives, suicide was enveloped in statistical
reporting. Coverage was often (but not universally) sympathetic. The
focus on the stories of individuals and a large written audience for
stories about suicide created the literary genre of the suicide note
(sometimes helped along&nbsp;by journalists providing them when absent).
Through these notes people tried to shape the narrative of their death
for their community and the wider world.</p>
<p>In step with these developments came near total resistance to sanctions
for the deceased or their survivors, which led to subsequent law
changes. Naturally social change was more complicated than that but the
role of newspapers was important. They made the reader’s world bigger
and the quietest voices louder.</p>
<p>Working from that history I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is
always wrong to print suicide notes and that no good can come of
reporting suicides.</p>
<p>There isn’t a reason given in the Samaritans guide as to why suicide
notes shouldn’t be reported, but working from the general theory
of&nbsp;suicide contagion the fear is that it risks increasing identification
with the deceased and identification might lead to&nbsp;imitation. I dislike
the view that suicide notes should only be seen as infectious spores.
They might also be the last way to understand a person&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>While the evidence for suicide contagion exists (more patchy than often
stated, but still worth taking seriously) this doesn’t apply to all
guidelines proposed. Restrictions on printing suicide method are well
evidenced, most other areas are more theoretical (and I suspect often
derive from backwards engineering terrible reporting – printing suicide
notes is in most cases tacky).</p>
<p>There is a small scientific field concerned with analysing suicide notes
but there is very little published on their effect on suicide contagion.
Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues[2] did investigate if citing a suicide
note effected suicide rates but found no effect – and this lack of
outcome merited no discussion. It’s just not a particular active
question in the field. The only area where a suicide note was discussed
at length I can find was an instance where releasing extracts from a
suicide note was seen as positive. I don’t buy this but it’s worth
looking at to understand solid ground is very hard to find here.</p>
<p>The idea of suicide contagion is best established with celebrity
suicides (Stack’s 2005 meta-analysis of the literature found no
ecological effect on suicide rates had been definitively proven outside
of celebrity studies[3]). As such after Kurt Cobain’s suicide there were
a few attempts to detect an effect in suicide rates. These failed to
find an effect (which is a good thing), and the explanations given for
this in the literature are interesting.</p>
<p>Martin, Graham. “Media Influence to Suicide : The Search for Solutions.”
Archives of Suicide Research 4, no. 1 (2007): 51–66:</p>
<blockquote>
One major difference appears to be the attitude actively promoted by
Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, by his family and subsequently by the
media. Immediately following the death Love made an audiotape
containing excerpts from a note left by Cobain; she commented in a
negative fashion on each part (Gaines, 1994, p. 107). For instance;
“I don’t have the passion anymore, so remember – (And don’t, because
this is a f…ing lie) – It’s better to burn out than fade away (God,
you asshole.) (Sandford, 1995, p.244)”</blockquote>
<p>Gould, M S. “Suicide and the Media.” Annals of the New York Academy of
Sciences 932 (April 2001): 200–214 :</p>
<blockquote>
Yet, celebrity suicides do not always yield imitative suicides, as
evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in suicides
following the death of Kurt Cobain. [...] [T]he substantial efforts
by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, to present his suicide in a
negative fashion may have counteracted any potential glamorization
of his death.</blockquote>
<p>The argument essentially goes “there was no imitative effect, therefore
the response did something right”, yet I suspect if you asked Martin if
we should be printing but dismantling suicide notes he wouldn’t argue
for that forcefully. This argument is grasping at straws a little and
paints an overly progressive picture of the media response to Cobain’s
death. If it really was a good response we might need to change media
guides more. After all, the Seattle Times printed a front page image of
Cobain's dead body<a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/126631/how-seattle-times-covered-cobains-death-17-years-ago-today/#more-126631">the next
day</a>on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his picture met that test by establishing an essential reality
about Cobain’s death. Our concern was that Cobain’s suicide would be
romanticized by some – suicide, the ultimate high.</p>
<p>As one editor said, the photo showed, ‘This wasn’t cool, it was
death and that’s the result of suicide.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, media guides would advise against such a thing but they’re
essentially working from the same hymn sheet that you shouldn’t glorify
the dead. Why are the Samaritans right and the Seattle Times wrong?</p>
<p>I want to dismantle the idea of expert opinion a bit here. I don’t think
anyone has any particularly good evidence why there was no detectable
effect after Cobain's suicide and I don’t think anyone has any evidence
that you shouldn’t print suicide notes. I trust well-intentioned people
working at charities trying to save lives a little more than I trust
well-intentioned people who also like to sell newspapers, but simply
having the right&nbsp;intentions is not enough.</p>
<p>Take this situation; we have two sets of well-intentioned people – one
set want to bring wider light to a story in the hope of saving lives,
the other set think this is dangerous because telling this story could
kill more people. This is important stuff, who is right?</p>
<p>Here are the key questions. The Samaritans explicitly state their
guidelines are only advisory;&nbsp;has&nbsp;suicide contagion been demonstrated to
such an&nbsp;extent that there can be no exceptions to guidance? I'd argue
not. Is there any evidence suggesting suicide notes in particular cause
harm? Again, the answer's no.</p>
<p>By all means, be concerned - but let's not pretend anyone knows which
course of action saves more lives.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A side point, but after The Samaritans’ <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users">Radar controversy</a> worth thinking about.</p>
<p>My thinking on this hasn't solidified yet, but there’s a touch of a
paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill in the advice not to
print suicide notes. We’re told “avoid the suggestion that a single
incident […] was the cause” - after all suicide is complicated and often
involves mental illness - but also not to report why they said they did
it. The implication here is that these people were not qualified to tell
you why they were suffering. This is even more unsettling when written
by a member of a group who specifically highlights their treatment as
part of that group: “They can’t know what they’re talking about, they’re
ill.&quot;&nbsp;I think this is accepted uncritically a bit wider than it should
be.</p>

					<p>Bob Clarke's 'From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History
of English Newspapers to 1899' (#booksthatgooglegivesyoudirectionsfor)
is a fantastic guide to the development of English newspapers but
importantly also&nbsp;very funny. &nbsp;Clarke has a gift for bringing some of the
more absurd features of the early profession.:</p>
<p><strong>What was Grub Street?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Grub Street is a metaphor for the hack writer. The word ‘hack’
derives from Hackney, originally meaning a horse for hire and later
a prostitute, a woman for hire. Finally, it was applied to a writer
for hire, a newspaper writer or a literary drudge. Paid by the line,
scratching a precarious living from the lower reaches of literature,
including journalism, the Grub Street hack received no public
acclaim, other than the sneers and jibes&nbsp;of his more successful
contemporaries who, by a mixture of ability and sycophancy,
had&nbsp;found the security of a patron.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Newspaper Corrections</strong></p>
<p>Surely one of the best newspaper correction in history belongs to the
Reading Mercury in 1765 - as provincial papers would print pages as news
came in during the week they could end up with corrections on page 2 for
content on page 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 1 - The following melancholy accident, we are informed,
happened on Friday last, at a principal Inn on the road to Reading,
viz. As a Gentleman was going up stairs he met the Landlady coming
down, when he insisted upon a kiss, which she complied with; but the
Gentleman not content with that, attempted to put his hand into her
bosom, which she resented, and pushing him from her, he
unfortunately fell down the stairs, broke his neck, and expired soon
after.</p>
<p>Page 3 -The story propagated about town (and which is inserted in
the former part of this paper) of a Gentleman attempting too great a
freedom with the Landlady of a great Inn on the road to Reading, and
that she pushed him down stairs, whereby he was killed, is without
any sort of foundation, no such circumstances having happened or
been attempted; but is supposed to arise from envy; on account of
the great resort of genteel company to the said Inn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The wonderful reason 'The Times' is 'The Times'</strong></p>
<blockquote>
It was founded by John Walter as the Daily&nbsp;Universal Register in
1785. Because the title was so long, people tended to ask for ‘the
Register’, and were likely to end with the Weekly Register, or the
Annual Register, or even Harris’s Register, the list of Covent
Garden whores. So in 1788 Walter remained his paper The Times.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some traditions started early</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Finally, there was the series of semi-pornographic newsbooks
produced by John Crouch: The Man in the Moon (1649-50), Mercurius
Democritus (1625-43); and Mercurius Fumigosus (1654-55), which
contained a mixture of genuine news and dirty jokes disguised as
news.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Embedded Journalists (or chaplains) in the Prison System</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Fuller accounts were to be found in the threepenny or sixpenny
broadsheets of Dying Confessions that were hawked about the street
after, and sometimes during, the execution. Many of these were the
work of the Ordinary or Chaplain of Newgate. The Ordinary would try
to obtain a full account of the life and crimes of the prisoner in
the condemned cell under the pretense that the prisoner ought to
confess all his sins to make his peace with God. If that did not
work, he would travel in the cart with the condemned&nbsp;man from
Newgate to try and wring some serviceable copy out of him.
Naturally&nbsp;the publicity value would not be so great if the prisoner
was reprieved. The Rev. James Villette once tried to prevent
the&nbsp;last-minute reprive of a fifteen-year-old boy by telling the
hangman&nbsp;to get on with it, as it was too late to worry about such
details.</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is well worth the read if you ever find yourself with a
copy.</p>

					<p>I set up a quick website to act as a portal for renters to the gov.uk
electoral registration page -
<a class="reference external" href="http://rentersvote.co.uk/">rentersvote.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Thought behind this: I had problems voting this May which I've gone into
more detail on
<a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/only-56-of-private-renters-are-registered-to-vote/">here</a>(short&nbsp;story:
moved late, was registered, administrative screw-up, couldn't vote - but
long story is more fun) and I've been thinking about the problem of
renters and elections in general.</p>
<p>The gulf in registration rates between private renters and homeowners is
huge (56 % vs 87%) - the political process is vastly weighted in favour
of current homeowners for various reasons but this&nbsp;bit&nbsp;seems like a
fairly tackle-able handicap.</p>
<p>Registration drives are not really a thing in the UK (while being huge
in the US), the annual canvass&nbsp;does a fairly good job at finding people
who are in the same place year after year - but is terrible at finding
the renters who are in a different place each time (data matching
experiments have been equally unpromising for renters).</p>
<p>The new online voter registration system is a massive improvement on the
previous way you had to register out of cycle (which to remind you: you
had to print off a pdf, write down all your stuff, post it, where
someone else would re-type it in) - this is now a five minute job
anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>This gives a point of an entry for a sectional registration drive. A
scheme targeted at getting private renters on the register should be
able to make an impact on that number.</p>
<p>There's a digital divide issue that'll need to be addressed at some
point (registrations forms are still printable and I created a very
basic flyer as an intermediary thing) but as digital is easier and the
hole in renter registration has a lot of young people who (technically)
use the internet there's a lot of scope in digital before needing to
expand offline.</p>
<p>This increase in renter registration would need to be converted
into&nbsp;greater salience for renter-friendly policies, but that's a
slightly harder problem.</p>

					<p>There's a good set of stories in the family about the First World War courtesy of my great-grandfather Reginald. This is a already a fine start - that's already an excellent name to have.</p>
<p>The idea of him as a proto-Flashheart is doubtless exaggerated (that said when he met&nbsp;his wife &quot;she was 18 and he was 24 and had been engaged twice before&quot;) - but according to the legend he not only discovered&nbsp;a German spy disguised as an army padre by noticing&nbsp;he was wearing the wrong number of pips, but rode a motorcycle through the trenches to save a friend’s girl from a nunnery threatened by the German advance. That one has it all really - solid story. Less on message, he caught typhoid fever - but recovered and survived the war.</p>
<p>His brother was less lucky. Harry Parsons died in an air raid in 1917 - an unlikely
way to go, only around 1,500 died because of raids in the entire war.
There’s a story passed down that he died wandering into the street to
get a better look at the Zeppelins, as it happens there are accounts of
people in London doing exactly this:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Raids hadn't become a very serious thing and everybody crowded out
into the street to watch. They didn't take cover or dodge.&quot; Lt
Charles Chabot, 39 Squadron RFC.</blockquote>
<p>But Harry wasn't one of them. As newspaper archives were
opened up my dad found what had been published at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
Henry Over Parsons, 33, violinist [...] According to Superintendent
Woolger, a fire brigade officer, the back part of the house was
demolished and the whole house of 18 rooms more or less damaged by
the explosion. A section of Royal Engineers found the body. The bed
appeared to have been turned right over and twisted into a most
fantastic shape. Deceased was thrown from the bed.</blockquote>
<p>The story about wandering into the street is
interesting, the report of this inquest is attached in the several
places it was syndicated with another where the coroner did mark people
going to look out their open doors as a contributor to their deaths. This possibly explains how
how this idea came into family legend. But there
were also direct experiences of the next generation that would colour
telling of the strange Great War bombings. Reginald was called up again in the
Second World War and during the Battle of Britain was &quot;standing on a
balcony [with another officer] watching an aerial dogfight overhead when
a spent cannon shell hit the other man, killing him.&quot; &nbsp;My grandfather
described his own memories of air-raids:</p>
<blockquote>
In September 1940 we were staying temporarily on our home in Acton.
I remember watching dockland burning on the night of September 7.
Every night for some weeks we slept under the kitchen table, pushed
under the staircase for further protection. I remember Brian, who
was 9, saying during one very noisy air raid, 'Mummy, I don't want
to die.' It could easily have happened. A bomb dropped in the front
garden of the house directly opposite us, but the blast went the
other way and our house was hardly damaged.</blockquote>
<p>From these you can see how&nbsp;the naivety&nbsp;of someone wanting to look could
become attached to a convenient&nbsp;relative. In general going into the
street says something about the period we want to be true -&nbsp;it reflects
how we retrospectively see the First World War. Bombers over London were
an intrusion of the ugly twentieth century on a world that didn't know
it was coming. We want them to be drawn to the novelty, like a child
playing with a brightly coloured snake. We want to offer them&nbsp;a moment
of realisation, to&nbsp;understand if nothing else, before that innocence is
lost.</p>
<p>But it's rare we're given that chance. It becomes clear only in retrospect when one world is over and another begun.</p>
<p>Another distant uncle (as so many of these stories involve by necessity)
William Pullen died in the Somme. On school trips to the battlefields my
siblings and I would look for his name. When they found the collection
of soldiers’ wills last year I requested a copy of his. He left all his
possessions to his mother.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There's more to say about Harry aside &quot;he died&quot; - some happy, much sad.</p>
<p>He was a gifted musician from a family of musicians. He goes to study at the Royal Academy of Music and while he's there he meets a girl, Jessie, who he performed in a duo with for several years before they get married (newspaper reports of these performances are a reminder that not only sad things are documented). They have a daughter together - and here is where things start to go wrong.</p>
<p>In what was either an exasperation of a long-standing problem or else a sudden change he becomes deeply unwell - both delusional and depressed. He goes home to Wales, but his mother can't handle caring for both her mentally disabled daughter (Elsie) and her increasingly manic and violent son - so she commits him to a local asylum.</p>
<p>After a few months there their daughter dies and Harry is checked out by his father (his absence from the family home suggests he may have away with Jessie and the baby). The discharge says he's 'unimproved' and he's back in within six months. He spends the next three years in the asylum.</p>
<p>He slowly improves. He starts eating more, the doctors note he's happier when playing the piano.  Eventually he leaves the asylum. He moves back to London and starts teaching the violin again. Within a year his house explodes and he dies being thrown from his bed.</p>
<p>Later Elsie would also be committed to the asylum as her parents became less able to care for her. She died inside of an epileptic fit after never speaking a word in her life. The family stayed in touch with Jessie, my granddad writes about meeting her.</p>

					<p>This is an excerpt from a much longer piece on the history of suicide
and journalism. &nbsp;It contains description of suicide&nbsp;methods only in so
far as they are required to demonstrate the point being made.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Across a number of countries there are media guidelines on suicide
reporting (most voluntary, but New Zealand’s are governed by law). These
arrived in the UK in 2006 when the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)
added a new clause to the Editors’ Code of Practice, extending the
guidelines on reporting on topics likely to involve personal grief with
an explicit prohibition on publishing ‘excessive detail’ about suicide
methods. The article now reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt;5. Intrusion into grief or shock</p>
<p>&gt;i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and
approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication
handled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report
legal proceedings, such as inquests.</p>
<p>ii) When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive
detail about the method used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule has now been in effect for eight years and there have now been
sufficient cases to make determinations on what exactly this rule has
meant in practice. How have complaints turned out? What exactly is
‘excessive’ detail?</p>
<p>There have been forty-six complaints under this clause - most complaints
are brought by relatives of the deceased, with a small number being
triggered by suicide prevention organisations&nbsp;or elected officials. In
one case the PCC itself brought the complaint against
fourteen&nbsp;newspapers over the same story.</p>
<p>Many complaints are resolved with an apology or a voluntary redaction of
their online archive by the newspaper - but in some cases the PCCs
reasoning over what level of detail is or isn’t ‘excessive’ becomes
clearer. Examining all rulings involving 5.ii, I found that the PCC to
date have chosen to interpret it as a rule against popularizing or
explaining unusual or technical methods of suicide. Details tend to be
allowed when the method can in some sense be seen as ‘obvious’. To use
specific cases, it is wrong to tell people how many pills are a fatal
dose or how a suicide involving a balloon kit was accomplished but it is
acceptable to describe someone as having hung themselves with their
shoelaces.</p>
<p>In the case of hanging (a minority of PCC complaints but the most common
method of suicide in the UK), the PCC has repeated argued the material
used to perform the act does not constitute part of the method. In the
very first complaint under 5.ii it was argued
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==</a>] that the
inclusion of a “photograph taken from the centre’s CCTV footage of [a
man] walking towards a stairwell with a bed sheet tied around his neck”
was not excessive as the rule was ‘designed to prevent the inclusion of
detail in newspaper reports that might provoke ‘copycat’ suicides. The
inclusion of a photograph of the complainant’s father before his death
did not raise an issue under this part of the Code.’ Similarly, in 2011
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==">http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==</a>] a complaint
that about including the fact that someone had hung ‘himself with
shoelaces’ was included in the headline was rejected, arguing that “the
article had only referred to the material with which the complainant had
hanged himself. The Commission found that the reference under complaint
did not represent an excessive detail such that would represent a breach
of the Code.”.</p>
<p>The PCC also rejected a complaint in 2008 that inclusion of a picture of
a noose in a story about suicides in Bridgend was an excessive amount of
detail - “It had to have regard to the fact that – regrettably – there
had been a spate of deaths by hanging, and that this fact was
well-known. The picture of the noose did not make public anything new
about the deaths, or describe the actual process by which individuals
had used particular materials to take their own lives.”</p>
<p>This approach is a problem because contrary to the idea that everybody
already knows how to hang themselves, information about exact hanging
techniques varies and even minor details can change how attractive the
idea of hanging is to a person. Biddle et al. [1] conducted a study with
people who had attempted suicide explicitly aimed at finding out why
they did or didn’t choose hanging as a method. People who tried hanging
believed it would be quick, easy and could be done with materials to
hand. People who did not believed it would be slow, painful or that they
lacked the technical know-how or rope to make the noose. This last point
is especially important, for hanging object is method - this is
information that change the desirability of the method. The PCC fixation
on technical or pharmaceutical suicides misses the purpose of the rule -
the concealment of unnecessary elements that might change the likelihood
someone puts into practice a given method.</p>
<p>As shown earlier [in not published sections], method and suicidal intent
is highly interlinked - restricting methods (either through physical
restrictions or by creating ignorance) is the most effective way of
having an effect on suicide across a society. This is the area where the
scientific evidence is most certain and if journalists can be convinced
of this solitary point it would account for most of the effect any wider
restrictions would give. The PCC (or its successor body) needs to take
into scope ‘obvious’ suicide methods and descriptions that might make
them more salient in the mind of a reader. These are after all the most
common and so an area where efforts would be likely to have the most
impact.</p>
