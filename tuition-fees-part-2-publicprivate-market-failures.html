post</a>
explored, my reading of the Browne report is that they found it's the
responsibility of the state to ensure a decent level of funding for
education but also that the government decision making process can't be
trusted to carry this out -&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;a system in which money is
compelled out of the government coffers as loans, with prices set
elsewhere. The Browne report redefines the role of the state so that
there is no splitting of the burden between public and private sources,
but the state simply&nbsp;provides&nbsp; the capital upfront to allow your future
private self to fund your education. In this way it changes government's
role from being the representation of the public interest to one where
it plays banker and is no longer required to make funding decisions.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this in a few courses that are deemed to require
continued public funding. While the courses listed are discussed only in
terms of economic worth, keeping any idea of a cultural benefit firmly
out of range, what the report’s actually getting at here isn’t just
which courses are and aren’t economically required but mostly that these
are courses that are more expensive to run, and so require subsidies to
hide the true cost from students who might be put off. This amounts to
an acknowledgement of the fairly obvious reality that students will be
put off from one course as opposed to another on the basis of price
(even when the cost isn't paid upfront) and concludes that the
intimidation of higher fees for economically vital professions is
considered serious enough that intervention is required. But to play the
free-market position for a moment (and indeed use the language used
elsewhere in the report), surely if these professions are truly vital,
their future employers will pay higher wages that justify the investment
they make in an education? If student choice has failed us here, are
there other instances we should correct for the market?</p>
<p>Interestingly this means the Browne report does have a notion of the
public good, but only in so far as we have enough engineers - there is
no such argument made, for instance, that there is a good in having our
elite institutions truly open to all. [1. I agree with Paul Sager that
if we’re looking at elite institutions as a way for the poor to leapfrog
into the higher echelons of society this <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2010/11/19/tuition-fees-social-justice-and-social-mobility/">isn’t the best conception of
the overall
problem</a>,
but that said a system in which the existing elite completely dominate
the institutions that perpetuate it is even more undesirable than one in
which that’s only partly true.] &nbsp;Browne at the same time as basing its
system around the idea of student (consumer) choice, keeps pulling back
from the idea that students are actually capable of making the correct
decisions – and to be honest they’re probably right to - it’s not at all
clear that even given ridiculous amounts of metrics prospective students
will be in any position to make educated choices, as laid out in Stefan
Collini’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble">excellent critique of
Browne</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Browne appears to believe that the only relevant measure of teaching
quality is ‘student satisfaction’. That is how the system will work:
if they are satisfied, they’ll pay, and if not, not; and the
pressure they exert thereby will ‘drive up quality’. But this, other
problems aside, comes perilously close to reducing important human
experiences to a set of ‘preferences’ as reported on a tick-box
questionnaire. I would hope the students I teach come away with
certain kinds of dissatisfaction (including with themselves: a
‘satisfied’ student is nigh-on ineducable), and it matters more that
they carry on wondering about the source of that dissatisfaction
than whether they ‘liked’ the course or not. This is another respect
in which the ‘consumer’ model is simply misleading, an error
encouraged by the prevalence in current edspeak of the category of
‘the student experience’ (many universities now have a senior figure
entitled Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Student Experience). It may be that
the most appropriate way to decide whether the atmosphere in the
student bar is right is by what students say when asked in a
questionnaire whether they ‘like’ it or not. But this is obviously
not the best way to decide whether a philosophy degree should have a
compulsory course on Kant. The philosophy department might hope
that, some time after graduation, most of its former students would
come to see the wisdom of this requirement, but ‘student
satisfaction’ is not what is at issue here. That this recognition is
retrospective tells us something important about education:
individuals often need to be told by someone who knows that a
particular line of study is worth pursuing whether at the time they
want to or not.</blockquote>
<p>While the report writers attempted to solve the perceived inability of
politicians to make the right call on education by turning that decision
over to a market, it’s not at all clear that the mechanism they picked
is appropriate to the task and the report itself doesn’t have a great
deal of trust in prospective students to make the right decisions when
it’s really important. The vaguely tragic thing about the Browne report
is that the version that arrived in the final coalition plan doesn’t
even seem to achieve its own ends. Its goal of separating education
funding from government oversight has failed as the caps mean that many
universities will raise their fees to the cap just to replace cuts and
so future governments will be required to either raise the cap or
increase public investment in order to inject more money into the
system. I don’t think it’s a universally terrible plan, the repayment
plan is genuinely more progressive but it’s not at all convincing that
the fees based market approach gives enough benefits to justify the

effects</a>
that putting the price upfront &nbsp;produces.</p>
