					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/13147230-198x300.jpg" />After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/terry-pratchett-sex-death-and-nature">this great
interview</a>
with Terry Pratchett&nbsp;I decided to go back and finish this post I was
writing about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth">*The Long
Earth*</a>, Pratchett's
recent collaboration with Stephen Baxter.&nbsp;Obviously, spoilers spoilers.</p>
<p>Basic setting summary: In <em>The Long Earth</em>, someone releases schematics
on the internet for an easy to build box with a switch. When the switch
is pressed, the user can travel either 'east' or 'west' through
infinite&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;Earths, with the near Earths being very similar to the
original 'datum' earth (but lacking in people) with weirder and wilder
creatures waiting in the far off Earths.&nbsp;One of the fun things about
reading collaborations between well-known authors is trying to break
down who introduced what elements.&nbsp;Sometimes you can pick up the voices,
but in cases like the Long Earth tracking the lineage of the ideas
involved is illuminating.&nbsp;While based on an old idea of Pratchett's, the
threads of it have appeared in a few previous Baxter books (which is
probably why the project is such a good fit.)</p>
<p>In Baxter's <em>Origin</em>, the world is changed by the&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of the Red
Moon (which replaces the boring grey one). The Red Moon travels
from&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;earth to parallel earth, opening up portals and picking up
and depositing creatures from world to world. Through this, it picked up
humanity's&nbsp;predecessors at various points in history and deposited them
on other earths, where they evolve in different and similar ways,
aquatic apes, puritans with tails, super-intelligent&nbsp;gorillas who hug
the surface of their gigantic and windswept Earth. So the idea that
there are places beside our own where humanity's cousins (in <em>The Long
Earth</em>'s case Trolls and Elves) developed in their own strange ways is
a&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>That Trolls are largely peaceful creatures who make people feel better
by singing while Elves are intelligent, malicious hunters where some
species farm others for their brains fits into the Pratchett&nbsp;rebellion
against Tolkien regarding elves (from <em>Lords and Ladies)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are terrific. They beget terror.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a
snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words
that have changed their meaning.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">No one ever said elves are nice.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are bad.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Long Earth</em> is also an example of, &nbsp;for lack of a better term,
&quot;Democratic Science Fiction&quot; - where an extraordinary change is put in
the hands of every person.&nbsp;What's a world like where everyone has
superpowers?&nbsp;&nbsp;When anyone can travel in time? When anyone can get a
potato and a switch, and step into another earth? This is ground Baxter
has visited before in a previous&nbsp;collaboration with Arthur C. Clark in
<em>The Light Of Other Days</em>, where the invention of wormhole technology
allows anyone to view any location, anywhere in history - effectively
abolishing privacy.</p>
<p>Lobsang is an interesting element, a sentient computer that claims to be
the reincarnated soul of a&nbsp;Tibetan&nbsp;car mechanic.&nbsp;Someone obscure
being&nbsp;reincarnated&nbsp;as a computer feels like a classic Pratchett&nbsp;footnote
joke (and there has been a 'Lobsang' in the Discworld-verse) , but it's
tempered and kept in line with a sci-fi universe by the heavy hinting
that Lobsang is just pretending to be reincarnated&nbsp;to have a better
claim to have personhood rights. To make an end of paragraph habit,
Baxter's collaboration with Clarke in the <em>Time Odyssey</em>&nbsp;series also
featured AI's with recognised rights.</p>
<p>You might guess from how often I've referred back to his previous books
that this story 'feels' more like Baxter than Pratchett but
his&nbsp;sensibilities&nbsp;are clearly there if you look. I wouldn't say it's
either of their greatest works, but it's a perfectly enjoyable read that
plays with its world in a way that I'm not sure would have come
naturally to either of them on their own.</p>
