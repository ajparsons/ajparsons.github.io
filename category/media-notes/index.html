					<p>Bob Clarke's 'From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History
of English Newspapers to 1899' (#booksthatgooglegivesyoudirectionsfor)
is a fantastic guide to the development of English newspapers but
importantly also&nbsp;very funny. &nbsp;Clarke has a gift for bringing some of the
more absurd features of the early profession.:</p>
<p><strong>What was Grub Street?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Grub Street is a metaphor for the hack writer. The word ‘hack’
derives from Hackney, originally meaning a horse for hire and later
a prostitute, a woman for hire. Finally, it was applied to a writer
for hire, a newspaper writer or a literary drudge. Paid by the line,
scratching a precarious living from the lower reaches of literature,
including journalism, the Grub Street hack received no public
acclaim, other than the sneers and jibes&nbsp;of his more successful
contemporaries who, by a mixture of ability and sycophancy,
had&nbsp;found the security of a patron.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Newspaper Corrections</strong></p>
<p>Surely one of the best newspaper correction in history belongs to the
Reading Mercury in 1765 - as provincial papers would print pages as news
came in during the week they could end up with corrections on page 2 for
content on page 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 1 - The following melancholy accident, we are informed,
happened on Friday last, at a principal Inn on the road to Reading,
viz. As a Gentleman was going up stairs he met the Landlady coming
down, when he insisted upon a kiss, which she complied with; but the
Gentleman not content with that, attempted to put his hand into her
bosom, which she resented, and pushing him from her, he
unfortunately fell down the stairs, broke his neck, and expired soon
after.</p>
<p>Page 3 -The story propagated about town (and which is inserted in
the former part of this paper) of a Gentleman attempting too great a
freedom with the Landlady of a great Inn on the road to Reading, and
that she pushed him down stairs, whereby he was killed, is without
any sort of foundation, no such circumstances having happened or
been attempted; but is supposed to arise from envy; on account of
the great resort of genteel company to the said Inn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The wonderful reason 'The Times' is 'The Times'</strong></p>
<blockquote>
It was founded by John Walter as the Daily&nbsp;Universal Register in
1785. Because the title was so long, people tended to ask for ‘the
Register’, and were likely to end with the Weekly Register, or the
Annual Register, or even Harris’s Register, the list of Covent
Garden whores. So in 1788 Walter remained his paper The Times.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some traditions started early</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Finally, there was the series of semi-pornographic newsbooks
produced by John Crouch: The Man in the Moon (1649-50), Mercurius
Democritus (1625-43); and Mercurius Fumigosus (1654-55), which
contained a mixture of genuine news and dirty jokes disguised as
news.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Embedded Journalists (or chaplains) in the Prison System</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Fuller accounts were to be found in the threepenny or sixpenny
broadsheets of Dying Confessions that were hawked about the street
after, and sometimes during, the execution. Many of these were the
work of the Ordinary or Chaplain of Newgate. The Ordinary would try
to obtain a full account of the life and crimes of the prisoner in
the condemned cell under the pretense that the prisoner ought to
confess all his sins to make his peace with God. If that did not
work, he would travel in the cart with the condemned&nbsp;man from
Newgate to try and wring some serviceable copy out of him.
Naturally&nbsp;the publicity value would not be so great if the prisoner
was reprieved. The Rev. James Villette once tried to prevent
the&nbsp;last-minute reprive of a fifteen-year-old boy by telling the
hangman&nbsp;to get on with it, as it was too late to worry about such
details.</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is well worth the read if you ever find yourself with a
copy.</p>
