                </h2>

					<p>Notes on Craig Lambert's 'Shadow Work: The Unpaid, Unseen Jobs That Fill
Your Day'. Short: just read the article version - doesn't gain much from
book length.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Lambert's:</p>
<blockquote>
I ADAPTED THIS term from the 1981 book Shadow Work by Austrian
philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich. For Illich, shadow work
included all the unpaid labor done in a wage-based economy, such as
housework. In a subsistence economy, work directly answers the needs
of life: gathering food, growing crops, building shelters, tending
fires. But once money and wages come into play, we encounter a whole
range of tasks that do not address our basic needs. Instead, such
jobs enable us to earn money to buy necessities and, if possible,
luxuries. That is paid work, not our subject here. This book will
identify and describe the unpaid jobs (like commuting) that an
industrial economy spins off for its citizens. Such jobs go
unnoticed because they take place in the wings of the theater while
we are absorbed in the onstage drama of our lives. They exist in the
shadows. Yet they are every bit as real as anything in the
spotlight.</blockquote>
<p>'Adapted' is probably the right word - the critique of self-help is a
bit more fierce in in Illich's original. Illich's definition of shadow
work:</p>
<blockquote>
I call this compliment to wage labour 'shadow work'. It comprises
most housework women do in their homes and apartments, the
activities&nbsp;connected with shopping, most of the homework of students
cramming for exams, the toil&nbsp;expended commuting to and from the job.
It includes the stress of forced consumption, the tedious and
regimented surrender to therapists, compliance&nbsp;with bureaucrats, the
preparation for work to which one is compelled, and many of&nbsp;the
activities usually labelled 'family life'. (p 100)</blockquote>
<p><strong>The false virtue of self-reliance</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Yet, unquestionably, it gives us more to do. Minor tasks like
returning our supermarket shopping carts to a holding pen or busing
our own Starbucks tables have become routine. “Why am I doing this?”
asked Daniel, a philosophy professor in western Massachusetts,
wheeling his empty shopping cart to the collection area. “What
happened to those teenagers who used to collect these things? I kind
of liked watching them push about twenty carts, all nested together,
across the parking lot.”</blockquote>
<p>A sign a few pages in that I'm not necessarily on the same wavelength.
Almost the idea here that tidying up after yourself &nbsp;(and this being
framed as a virtue) is a con so companies don't have to pay people to
clean up after you (and selfish of you because you're denying them
jobs). Possible I'm just socialised into finding that odd but
mechanically, it's only a short jump to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">broken window
fallacy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Mobility</strong></p>
<blockquote>
If these bankers had gone out on hundreds of mortgage appraisals
like my dad did, seeing the actual houses for which they were
lending money and meeting real, live borrowers, would the 2008
banking crisis have happened?</blockquote>
<p>Probably? I think it's hard to argue that&nbsp;<em>no</em> bad decisions were ever
made&nbsp;before people put their own trolleys away?</p>
<blockquote>
But how does an aspiring banker work his way up from the teller’s
window if ATMs and shadow-working customers have displaced tellers?
How does a secretary become the office manager and later an
executive if shadow work eliminates support staff— so there are no
secretaries?</blockquote>
<p>Here we get to interesting questions about social mobility. I'll come
back to this.</p>
<blockquote>
For those without education and skills, these low-level positions
often are their careers. If such jobs vanish, a throng of unemployed
young people will find themselves with little money and too much
spare time. This is a dangerous development in any society. Unrest
and violence throughout the Arab world have erupted from streets
teeming with young men lacking jobs— angry youths who congregate
online through social media. Such mobs can become unruly. In 2003,
the dissolution of the Iraqi army put 400,000 young men out of work
, triggering a bloody insurgency that still continues. In today’s
global village, where citizens network and congregate in political
flashmobs, we cannot risk creating an immense underclass of idle
youth.</blockquote>
<p>De-Ba'athification and self-checkouts seem like extreme companions. Is
the issue of this situation no means of support (money can be exchanged
for goods and services) or spare&nbsp;time (Victorians standardise football
to attempt to control spare&nbsp;time, mixed results)? One&nbsp;is better to
intervene in than the other. Are there better solutions than just
maintain rubbish jobs?</p>
<p><strong>House Work</strong></p>
<p>Illich argues that this unpaid work is a necessary shadow component to
allow wage labour to exist at all and comes back to the unpaid work of
women again and again - &quot;The amount of shadow work laid on a person
today is a much better measure of discrimination than&nbsp;bias on the job&quot;(p
101). &nbsp;Lambert takes this to an extent, discussing medical students
where female doctors in training were found to spend far more time
performing household duties compared to their male counterparts but
pulls back from this at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a place for amateur work. Those domestic chores ground you
in daily realities that sometimes go by the name of life. They
connect you with your home, those rooms and furnishings that serve
you without complaint. They bond you to your family, because the
shadow work of housekeeping can be a tangible form of love. The fact
that my mom cooked our meals, washed our clothes, and hung them on a
clothesline to dry—even in winter— and kept our home clean and
orderly, meant so much to my father, sister, brother, and me. Mom
wanted us to have the conditions for a healthy and happy life.
Keeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow work. When
a paid cook, laundress, nanny, or maid does household tasks, the
jobs may be executed very well, but they’re done for a salary, not
from love of family. Inevitably, the work of servants has a
different feeling.</blockquote>
<p>Lambert's version of &quot;Shadow Work&quot; is noticeable less biting than
Illich's. If we accept that supermarkets tricking us with 'self
reliance' to do our own checkout is promoting virtue as a con, it's hard
to see how &quot;[k]eeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow
work&quot; is any less so. Shadow work that dents the prospects of men like
his father to work up the ladder is bad, shadow work by women that
enabled his father the time to do that is good. I don't mind a
definition of shadow work where it &quot;just is&quot; rather than being bad
(giving free labour) or good (control and privacy) &nbsp;- but when so much
of the tone of the book is&nbsp;&quot;You didn't realise you were doing other
people's jobs for them you sucker&quot; bits like this stick out.</p>
<p><strong>Internships</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The upshot is an army of young people doing full-time shadow work
for months or even years, trying to break into the job market as
unpaid trainees.</blockquote>
<p>Say there's a good book about that...</p>
<blockquote>
The internship juggernaut represents a massive, widespread,
institutionalized form of shadow work. The 2011 exposé Intern
Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New
Economy, by Ross Perlin, offers a biting critique of the internship
explosion.</blockquote>
<p>Which Lambert has also read, so just go read that. Accept these are
related problems&nbsp;but&nbsp;has to be a distinction between consumers taking on
the work of the companies they buy from (doing work that reduces costs
for free) and doing a recognisable job for free (internships). Is a
definition of shadow work that encompasses both actually useful?</p>
<p><strong>Servants and Service</strong></p>
<blockquote>
In the United States, we feel a profound ambivalence about receiving
personal service. In this respect, America differs from the Old
World, where monarchs ruled for centuries. Europeans are accustomed
to royalty, nobility, and aristocracies, settled in their palaces
and great mansions with domestic servants. Indeed, hereditary
monarchs still sit on thrones in Britain, Spain, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Europe has long lived
with an entrenched class structure that included a servant class
waiting on their “betters.” Consequently, Old World cultures feel a
degree of comfort with personal service.</blockquote>
<p>This is at best simplistic. Lucy Lethbridge's&nbsp;<em>'Servants: A Downstairs
View of Twentieth-century Britain</em>' has an excellent running thread on
the aristocracy slowly learning to do things themselves. For a bit more
historical background on how changes in available labour and funds led
the upper-class to &quot;shadow-work&quot; read that (although &quot;Hey what were the
rich up to?&quot; is not the point of the book).&nbsp;Small snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
Concessions were made towards slightly smaller numbers of household
staff but also to a generation that had begun to enjoy some
independence and was not quite as deficient in practical skills as
its parents’ generation had been. Breakfasts in grand houses, for
example, became increasingly self-service, the dishes arranged on
the sideboard</blockquote>
<p>Bringing the historical picture into it is exactly what a book on
&quot;shadow work&quot; should do (and what Illich does at length with the rise of
wage labour). Is &quot;Removing entry level work reduces social mobility&quot;
just a modern variation of &quot;but how will people become butlers if there
are less entry level servant jobs?&quot; If not, why not? What lessons does
the decline of servants have for the decline of a service-economy?</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;Lambert's assertion that tipping is an Americanism resulting from
an unease to personal service is obviously&nbsp;ahistorical. It's not only a
European import but was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12tipping-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp">resisted by
Americans</a>
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>This section of the book is pretty clearly padding to reach the word
limit, but by extending the concept to dating it completely falls apart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, people met dating partners through family and
friends, at work, or through hobbies and social events. Today,
various businesses also facilitate linking up. Professional
matchmakers introduce their clients for a fee. Printed or online
personal ads, singles groups and events (not just drinking and
dancing but singles yoga classes, cycling trips, and gardening
clubs), and “speed dating” help make connections. The fact that
these businesses exist testifies that traditional ways of meeting
are no longer getting the job done.</p>
<p>[...]Dating-site questionnaires probe views and preferences to build
personality profiles. The data archive that shadow-working customers
create for free becomes (like Facebook’s content) a valuable capital
asset that the sites can monetize. In one sense, providing this data
is just the obvious ante: You have to pony up information to play
the game. On the other hand, it’s a task that does not arise when
people meet via real social networks rather than virtual ones. In
this way it qualifies as shadow work, as the dating site puts it in
place.</p>
<p>[...]Late-night OkCupid work can mean sleeping less and finding
yourself increasingly fatigued by the shadow work of dating.
“Typically I would send messages back and forth via the site three
times before one of us would suggest exchanging cell phone numbers
to arrange a meeting,” Rachel says. “Once I had someone’s number I
would probably exchange another three text messages to decide on a
place and time and confirm meeting up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really, really pushing it. If &quot;talking to people&quot; is shadow-work
literally anything that involves effort is now shadow-work. Is this
unpaid work that makes wage labour possible? Is it even self-servicing
what used to be done by wage labour? If we accept that amateur labour
(doing work that others would be paid for) counts as shadow-work, then
people match-making their friends is shadow-work because they're doing
work that people are paying online sites to do.&nbsp;The concept as Lambert
uses it means absolutely nothing.</p>
