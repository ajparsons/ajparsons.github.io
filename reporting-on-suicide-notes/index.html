					<p>An
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2015/01/if-you-believe-trans-lives-matter-dont-share-leelah-alcorns-suicide-note-social">article</a>&nbsp;went
up on The New Statesman today arguing&nbsp;that people sharing the suicide
note of a trans-person were actually endangering the very people they
were trying to raise awareness of. This is&nbsp;based on The Samaritans
guidelines&nbsp;that journalists should&nbsp;not print the content of suicide
notes because of the idea of 'suicide contagion' - arguing that
including details of suicide notes can make it more likely people will
try and emulate the note's author.</p>
<p>My opinion of the Samaritan’s guidelines is
they offer&nbsp;good generalised advice that should be read and often
followed. That said, specific guidance is often detached from supporting
evidence and shouldn't be used as an authority to beat people with.
There are circumstances where blindly following guidance has the
potential to do harm and I think this is one of them.</p>
<p>To understand why the contagious understanding of the suicide note is a
bit narrow we need to know a bit more history. I go into this in far
more detail in the finished piece but my basic premise is that over the
last few centuries’ media coverage of suicide played a significant part
in making us a better, kinder&nbsp;society&nbsp;more understanding of
those&nbsp;amongst us most in pain.</p>
<p>To quickly summarise historian Michael MacDonald’s argument [1] -
newspapers secularised suicide by making it a mundane fact of life. The
syndication of suicide stories made the fact of suicide a constant
low-level noise as opposed to something that would happen in smaller
communities incredibly infrequently. From stories of the devil stalking
the earth and taking lives, suicide was enveloped in statistical
reporting. Coverage was often (but not universally) sympathetic. The
focus on the stories of individuals and a large written audience for
stories about suicide created the literary genre of the suicide note
(sometimes helped along&nbsp;by journalists providing them when absent).
Through these notes people tried to shape the narrative of their death
for their community and the wider world.</p>
<p>In step with these developments came near total resistance to sanctions
for the deceased or their survivors, which led to subsequent law
changes. Naturally social change was more complicated than that but the
role of newspapers was important. They made the reader’s world bigger
and the quietest voices louder.</p>
<p>Working from that history I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is
always wrong to print suicide notes and that no good can come of
reporting suicides.</p>
<p>There isn’t a reason given in the Samaritans guide as to why suicide
notes shouldn’t be reported, but working from the general theory
of&nbsp;suicide contagion the fear is that it risks increasing identification
with the deceased and identification might lead to&nbsp;imitation. I dislike
the view that suicide notes should only be seen as infectious spores.
They might also be the last way to understand a person&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>While the evidence for suicide contagion exists (more patchy than often
stated, but still worth taking seriously) this doesn’t apply to all
guidelines proposed. Restrictions on printing suicide method are well
evidenced, most other areas are more theoretical (and I suspect often
derive from backwards engineering terrible reporting – printing suicide
notes is in most cases tacky).</p>
<p>There is a small scientific field concerned with analysing suicide notes
but there is very little published on their effect on suicide contagion.
Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues[2] did investigate if citing a suicide
note effected suicide rates but found no effect – and this lack of
outcome merited no discussion. It’s just not a particular active
question in the field. The only area where a suicide note was discussed
at length I can find was an instance where releasing extracts from a
suicide note was seen as positive. I don’t buy this but it’s worth
looking at to understand solid ground is very hard to find here.</p>
<p>The idea of suicide contagion is best established with celebrity
suicides (Stack’s 2005 meta-analysis of the literature found no
ecological effect on suicide rates had been definitively proven outside
of celebrity studies[3]). As such after Kurt Cobain’s suicide there were
a few attempts to detect an effect in suicide rates. These failed to
find an effect (which is a good thing), and the explanations given for
this in the literature are interesting.</p>
<p>Martin, Graham. “Media Influence to Suicide : The Search for Solutions.”
Archives of Suicide Research 4, no. 1 (2007): 51–66:</p>
<blockquote>
One major difference appears to be the attitude actively promoted by
Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, by his family and subsequently by the
media. Immediately following the death Love made an audiotape
containing excerpts from a note left by Cobain; she commented in a
negative fashion on each part (Gaines, 1994, p. 107). For instance;
“I don’t have the passion anymore, so remember – (And don’t, because
this is a f…ing lie) – It’s better to burn out than fade away (God,
you asshole.) (Sandford, 1995, p.244)”</blockquote>
<p>Gould, M S. “Suicide and the Media.” Annals of the New York Academy of
Sciences 932 (April 2001): 200–214 :</p>
<blockquote>
Yet, celebrity suicides do not always yield imitative suicides, as
evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in suicides
following the death of Kurt Cobain. [...] [T]he substantial efforts
by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, to present his suicide in a
negative fashion may have counteracted any potential glamorization
of his death.</blockquote>
<p>The argument essentially goes “there was no imitative effect, therefore
the response did something right”, yet I suspect if you asked Martin if
we should be printing but dismantling suicide notes he wouldn’t argue
for that forcefully. This argument is grasping at straws a little and
paints an overly progressive picture of the media response to Cobain’s
death. If it really was a good response we might need to change media
guides more. After all, the Seattle Times printed a front page image of
Cobain's dead body<a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/126631/how-seattle-times-covered-cobains-death-17-years-ago-today/#more-126631">the next
day</a>on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his picture met that test by establishing an essential reality
about Cobain’s death. Our concern was that Cobain’s suicide would be
romanticized by some – suicide, the ultimate high.</p>
<p>As one editor said, the photo showed, ‘This wasn’t cool, it was
death and that’s the result of suicide.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, media guides would advise against such a thing but they’re
essentially working from the same hymn sheet that you shouldn’t glorify
the dead. Why are the Samaritans right and the Seattle Times wrong?</p>
<p>I want to dismantle the idea of expert opinion a bit here. I don’t think
anyone has any particularly good evidence why there was no detectable
effect after Cobain's suicide and I don’t think anyone has any evidence
that you shouldn’t print suicide notes. I trust well-intentioned people
working at charities trying to save lives a little more than I trust
well-intentioned people who also like to sell newspapers, but simply
having the right&nbsp;intentions is not enough.</p>
<p>Take this situation; we have two sets of well-intentioned people – one
set want to bring wider light to a story in the hope of saving lives,
the other set think this is dangerous because telling this story could
kill more people. This is important stuff, who is right?</p>
<p>Here are the key questions. The Samaritans explicitly state their
guidelines are only advisory;&nbsp;has&nbsp;suicide contagion been demonstrated to
such an&nbsp;extent that there can be no exceptions to guidance? I'd argue
not. Is there any evidence suggesting suicide notes in particular cause
harm? Again, the answer's no.</p>
<p>By all means, be concerned - but let's not pretend anyone knows which
course of action saves more lives.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A side point, but after The Samaritans’ <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users">Radar controversy</a> worth thinking about.</p>
<p>My thinking on this hasn't solidified yet, but there’s a touch of a
paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill in the advice not to
print suicide notes. We’re told “avoid the suggestion that a single
incident […] was the cause” - after all suicide is complicated and often
involves mental illness - but also not to report why they said they did
it. The implication here is that these people were not qualified to tell
you why they were suffering. This is even more unsettling when written
by a member of a group who specifically highlights their treatment as
part of that group: “They can’t know what they’re talking about, they’re
ill.&quot;&nbsp;I think this is accepted uncritically a bit wider than it should
be.</p>
