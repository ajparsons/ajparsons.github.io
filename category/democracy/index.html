					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?ID=292466&amp;R=R1&amp;utm_">Gilad Sharon's &quot;Flatten Gaza&quot;
article</a>
in the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post&nbsp;has been rightly widely condemned as being a
pretty horrible thing for a mainstream newspaper to publish (even
bearing in mind the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post also published a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">he went too far,
but is he
wrong?</a>&quot;&nbsp;article
after&nbsp;Brievik), one part especially jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
THE DESIRE to prevent harm to innocent civilians in Gaza will
ultimately lead to harming the truly innocent: the residents of
southern Israel. <strong>The residents of Gaza are not innocent, they
elected Hamas. The Gazans aren’t hostages; they chose this freely,
and must live with the consequences.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you remember 7/7 bomber&nbsp;Mohammad Sidique Khan's suicide tape, that
might be
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm">familiar&nbsp;sentiment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Your <strong>democratically elected governments</strong> continuously perpetuate
atrocities against my people all over the world.&nbsp;And <strong>your support
of them makes you directly responsible</strong>, just as I am directly
responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and
sisters.</blockquote>
<p>The principle here is simple: we elect our leaders, if our leaders chose
to wage war with our support then we are all legitimate targets, in or
out of uniform, on or off the battlefield. &nbsp;It's not just to weaken the
material war effort or 'morale' of the enemy (dodgy, but anyway),
democratic civilians are morally culpable and so&nbsp;indiscriminate&nbsp;violence
can be justified.</p>
<p>As it happens Sharon is just plain wrong on the facts, Hamas did win the
2006 elections but the current Hamas government in Gaza results from a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4">2007 takeover</a>.
More interesting for this question is exactly why they won in 2006 - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jps.2006.35.3.20">a
combination of the electoral system and severe splits within
Fatah</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Post-election surveys showed the price of this disunity, a
distortion magnified&nbsp;by an electoral system under which half the
seats were won in district races[at-large elections with multiple
seats] and the other half—the national list—were allocated according
to the list’s&nbsp;proportion of the national vote. Thus, Hamas won 29
seats (against Fatah’s 28)&nbsp;in the 66-seat national list with 44
percent of the vote. The non-Hamas vote&nbsp;(56 percent)was divided
between Fatah and the four other PLO or “Third Way”&nbsp;lists. But while
Hamas candidates won 45 (68 percent) of the 66 district seats&nbsp;in
parliament, they did so with 36.5 of the vote. Sixty-three percent
voted for&nbsp;non-Hamas candidates, the vast majority dispersed between
Fatah’s official and&nbsp;independent candidates. In the end, Fatah won a
mere 17 seats in the districts.&nbsp;On the basis of these figures it is
difficult to refute Awad’s conclusion. “Hamas&nbsp;did not win the
elections—Fatah lost them.” (p.26)</blockquote>
<p>That 36.5% figure is interesting because Labour in the 2005 elections
won with just a percent less, on 35.2% percent of the vote. &nbsp;In both
cases the 'culpable party' won with far less than majority support - can
we really say there's a lot of collective&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;there?</p>
<p>But wait - those are the figures for the whole of Palestine - maybe the
Gaza districts were more Hamas hardcore. No such luck, using the break
down of results from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/Palestine2006-NDI-final.pdf">Carter Center
report</a>
I made this table of how the vote played out (remember it's at-large
districts- as many votes as seats open - so there are many more votes
than voters):</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="44%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="17%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>District</strong></td>
<td><strong>Votes for Change &amp; Reform (Hamas)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Total Votes</strong></td>
<td><strong>&nbsp;% Hamas</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>North Gaza</td>
<td>170021</td>
<td>363832</td>
<td>46.73%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Gaza</td>
<td>364529</td>
<td>941959</td>
<td>38.70%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Deir al-Balah</td>
<td>79594</td>
<td>253882</td>
<td>31.35%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Khan Younis</td>
<td>160014</td>
<td>531480</td>
<td>30.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Rafah</td>
<td>61936</td>
<td>153247</td>
<td>40.42%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Total</td>
<td>836094</td>
<td>2244400</td>
<td>37.25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So even just within Gaza it's hard to argue Hamas had overwhelming
support.&nbsp;It's also worth remembering that Gaza has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html">a pretty high
proportion of
children</a>
(43.8% - 0-14) and so democratic decisions by the adult population
have&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/">more potential legitimacy
problems</a>&nbsp;than
might otherwise be the case. Saying children 'chose freely' to be bombed
because less than half of adults voted for a party six years ago might
be pushing democratic accountability a bit far.</p>

					<p>Looking back on my child voting notes I remembered an argument that I
didn't touch on last time <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">I wrote about votes for
children</a>:
&nbsp;that children's different experiences alone, regardless of any question
of&nbsp;competence&nbsp;is&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to justify&nbsp;representation.</p>
<p>What often annoys me about Votes at 16 arguments is that so many of the
arguments deployed are incredibly regressive.&nbsp;Children can pay tax, they
should vote! And we'll take away the vote from adults who don't? &nbsp;If we
lived in democracies with property requirements child voting advocates
would be arguing that 16-year-olds can own property and should vote, not
that there's something wrong with the basic idea.&nbsp;Fundamentally there's
no difference between this tax position and<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/">Ian Cowie's
idea</a>
that only those who paid more than £100 income tax should be allowed to
vote, which itself isn't a long way removed from an argument that the
rich pay for more more of the state, why shouldn't they have more of a
say?</p>
<p>British democracy has its origins in exactly this idea of a stakeholder
democracy, expanding to include any group that might threaten it from
the outside. But the real merit of democracy is that it is so disruptive
of existing norms - democracy shouldn't simply reflect other power
structures (the rich having more of a say than others, men wielding more
decision making power than women) but should work to undermine those
structures by expressing the always radical notion that
everyone&nbsp;deserves&nbsp;an equal say.</p>
<p>Children represent a distinct interest, a massive consumer of state
services (which occupy and direct a large amount of their time) and yet
the argument often deployed is that they are so like us that it would
unfair not to include them, not that they are so different we are
missing a vital voice. As <a class="reference external" href="http://chd.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/06/0907568211406756">Wall put
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[C]hildren may not always have as much autonomy or power as adults,
but they are every bit as different. If the purpose of democratic
representation is to respond to the fullest possible diversity of
social experiences, then it includes responding to children – and to
children’s endless diversity – just as much as it does to adults.
Indeed, children would take on a heightened status as the most
important test of being democratic, since they are more likely than
most to call for political responsiveness from the whole. <strong>Being
represented in the political sphere should not depend entirely on
how competently one can argue for one’s interests or how effectively
one can struggle against others for power. It should depend finally
on how different one’s experiences are from those of others.</strong> (p.
10)</p>
<p>The right to vote should be as expansive as possible because those
voted into office are given power over the lives of all. It should
be presumed that everyone can vote unless a compelling argument can
be provided for exclusion. Children’s right to vote is important if
elected representatives are to perform their democratic duties of
challenging historical marginalization and responding to
constituents’ fullest differences. (p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this perspective because the notion of letting children vote is
unsettling is an excellent reason to do it - it will disrupt current
power relations in a way that improve society. &nbsp;There's a fine argument
that actually, children are a different class of excluded person than
all previous examples because their immaturity is transitional - one day
they will grow up, no one is&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;excluded - but for the
'democracy as difference' argument this is hollow comfort because their
'difference' representing the child's interests is lost.&nbsp;If the blanket
inclusion this implies is too radical, there are schemes <a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/">that represent
children on a fractional
basis</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which
are at least no worse than complete exclusion).</p>
<p>My&nbsp;personal opinion on votes at 16 has always tended towards supportive
indifference, however currently&nbsp;I'm trying to write something long on
political equality and democracy and it's been eye opening to see how
many democratic theorists are just as willing to ignore the issue
('assume a population of adults' is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical
cow</a> of democratic
theory). It's becoming increasingly hard to hold to the stance that this
is an unimportant issue, in the UK the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx">proportion of the population
under
fifteen</a>
is 18% - in Iraq and Libya it's 43%, Tanzania 45%, Uganda 48%.&nbsp;In places
where the proportion of children to adults almost approaches parity,&nbsp;how
can any account of democracy that excludes children not be severely
flawed?</p>

					<p>Yesterday George&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;floated proposals that employers could offer
contracts that exchange '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9593955/George-Osborne-workers-of-the-world-unite...and-give-up-your-employment-rights.html">workplace rights for tax-free shares in the
company</a>'.
While on the surface, this is trading hard-won employment rights for
magic beans that may or may not be worth much (and in many businesses'
cases, a wily employer could make it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/10/the-fundamental-problem-with-osbornes-employee-ownership-plan">worth very little
indeed</a>)
that's no reason to be harsh on the principle which could be used for
any number of things - what are other rights worth?</p>
<p>Have a look through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art15">European Convention on Human
Rights</a> and ask
yourself, am I really ever going to use that?&nbsp;Take the prohibition in
Article 2 against the death penalty, even when we had it in the 20th
century we only executed around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats">11 people a
year</a>. Using
the 1900 population stats (which only increase and so make this even
more favourable) and assuming a life span of 80, I only have a&nbsp;0.002%
chance* of being&nbsp;executed in my lifetime &nbsp;- &nbsp;might I not be happy to
take few quid a year to waive&nbsp;my right not be executed?</p>
<p>Of course, no one is going to offer me money to waive that right&nbsp;for
exactly the same reason it might be appealing, &nbsp;it's not worth much to
me because the chances of execution are low and it's not worth much to
other people because the number of people wanting to execute me is also
low (hopefully). &nbsp;In the case for employment rights for shares, the
reasoning is that&nbsp;these are rights that people are quite likely to
exercise, but actually things would be better if they didn't.&nbsp;The ideal
situation for everyone is one where the right is worth very little to me
but quite a lot to someone else and there's an obvious candidate for
this - voting rights.</p>
<p>It's a famous problem for rational choice explanations of voting
behaviour&nbsp;that the benefit to the individual of voting is tiny compared
even to the very cheap costs of voting as the chances that your vote is
the one that changes the outcome is so tiny that taking it seriously is
like planning a route to work that avoids lottery-funded asteroid
strikes**. For those of us voting in safe seats we can be pretty
confident that our vote is almost entirely useless. &nbsp;The fact that
turnout still tends to be much higher than the 0% it should be is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting">Downs
Paradox</a>, and most
ways of resolving it rely on people voting on matters other than
self-interest, such as loyalty to the group or candidate, or even just
people think that voting is a Good Thing that should be encouraged and
gone through, even if the benefits to yourself are limited.</p>
<p>But what if we made it even more expensive to vote (or vote freely) by
offering money the other way?&nbsp;When <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172644/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/14/News/Most-Say.Their.Vote.Has.A.Price-3099547.shtml">a class of NYU students was polled
in
2007</a>,
two-thirds would exchange their vote for a free year of&nbsp;tuition, half
for a million dollars and&nbsp;&nbsp;20% were as cheap as an iPod Touch (then
between $300-400).&nbsp;This isn't just good for candidates and my wallet,
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pedrovicente.org/banho.pdf">study looking at São Tomé and
Príncipe</a>&nbsp;found that
decreasing vote-buying also hurt voter turnout and
increased&nbsp;incumbent&nbsp;advantage - which are bad things!</p>
<p>There may of course be downsides I'm missing to this, but while we're
working out which-rights-are-worth-how-much it's definitely something to
think about.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>*&nbsp;This is about the same odds as getting a straight flush in poker.
Here's the question, did me telling you that make you feel being
executed is more or less&nbsp;likely?&nbsp;Straight flushes are possible, your
chances of seeing one in every game you've ever played or seen are much
higher than the chances of getting one in your first game ever (which as
my odds were over a lifetime is equivalent). Likewise dramatic hands are
more likely to appear <a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">in film or TV
depictions</a>.
This is a problem because when I give an example of&nbsp;probability&nbsp;your
brain does a trick where instead of working on the odds, it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100184181/why-we-need-to-teach-parents-about-risk-and-statistics-in-the-wake-of-the-april-jones-horror/">tries to
think of an example of the thing
being&nbsp;described</a>
to assess the likelihood of it happening. Hence me giving the example of
a straight flush makes 0.002% seem far, far more&nbsp;likely&nbsp;than it actually
is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically we're terrible with risk.</p>
<p>** Note: may actually be more likely than that.</p>
