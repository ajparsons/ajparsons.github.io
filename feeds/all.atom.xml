Why is the
green belt &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.citymetric.com/politics/london-mayoral-race-why-wont-labours-candidates-get-serious-about-housing-1353"&gt;a sacred
cow&lt;/a&gt;
but affordable living not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to&amp;nbsp;basics: &amp;nbsp;'crisis' is an old medical work – meaning the
last time at which the patient can recover. Current meaning is closer to
‘decline that impairs ability to function’. This meaning can (and is)
deployed more often but lacks the urgency associated with original
meaning. Each year not building enough houses is creating more work for
future people&amp;nbsp;to build more houses than the currently demonstrated
ability to do so. There is no date at which housing can be said to have
succeeded/failed. Eternal little (or in reality large) failures – but
we’ll do better next year. Never said – “this is a permanent failure
that requires radical action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are very bad as saying ‘this has failed’ with ongoing processes.
We will produce less carbon in future than our current attitude and
resources suggests is likely – we will build more houses in future than
our current attitude and resources suggests is likely. Tomorrow is
someone else’s problem. The poor sap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there's a fundamental disconnect in how people perceive ‘housing
crisis’. When I talk about a housing crisis I’m thinking of a situation
where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many people living in substandard housing – with no political
will to improve situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too many people living in insecure housing (short tenure, other
people with physical access, risk of evictions) - with no political
will to improve situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prices of living in this undesirable situation is constantly
rising – with no political will to improve situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a more oblique level – a moral crisis. A rentier class extracts
wealth from another group who live in bad circumstances without
choice – making money from human misery. This class holds reasonable
lobbying power and sometimes as individuals direct political power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a ‘bad thing’ a crisis is that it is clear it will not just
recover on its own. Left to their own devices all the above will get
worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for most people a ‘housing crisis’ is more fundamental than
that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You either have a roof over your head or you don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the street is a crisis, rent being expensive is not. This is
young people whining about being young and poor people whining about
being poor. Change the record. The situation is not bad enough to
re-examine fundamental assumptions (individual resistance to new local
building, cultural resistance to reducing green belts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where is the “real” housing crisis? There’s an idea in climate change
that there are ‘carbon sinks’ that absorb carbon from atmosphere but at
some point they will decline in effectiveness and rise in atmospheric
CO2 proceeds much quicker. &amp;nbsp;This can&amp;nbsp;be reduced to a metaphor – ‘a
device that commutes effect of bad thing but will eventually stop’. What
are housing’s carbon sinks? For a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private landlords used to house people councils have legal duty
towards. Families housed in B&amp;amp;Bs for extended periods, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children living with parents for longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsustainable high proportions of income being spent on rent. Many
people on brink of affordability – in crisis will be unable to
afford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is most obvious give point – there is only so much housing that
can be used as emergency housing. To avoid the very bad thing of
children on the streets councils are shipping people to less expensive
areas. Headlines about people being taken away from their families and
lives – but reader might enter fairness paradigm at this point: ‘Why
should I pay so much to have a house in London and have the life I want
and someone else get it for free? If you can’t afford it you should go
somewhere cheaper’ (with even poorer job prospects, etc). So safety
valve on housing crisis folds into &amp;quot;poor people want something for
nothing&amp;quot; as opposed to “why is there nothing affordable?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second point is an obvious frustration to that generation and helps hide
full scale of housing shortage but again has obstacles to seeing it as a
real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally people want to believe in a just world and that people get
what they deserve. Children these days are just more dependent on their
parents, not like we were. A series of metaphors are deployed to mark
this generation as especially unable to cope outside the nest (itself a
metaphor for ‘maturity involves leaving home’). ‘Bank of Mum and Dad’ is
used as ‘kids will be financially irresponsible’ but also interestingly
‘too young to enter real financial world’. A requirement for
inter-generational wealth transfers appears to replace the institutions
and availability of capital that existed at an earlier time (and of
course, family wealth is not available to everyone) – but metaphor is
deployed as being between generations and reinforce idea of immaturity
of youth – not a comment on the different societies different
generations live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a lot of people weren’t working hard to keep homelessness down (by
finding enterprising ways to move people around to some form of shelter)
or opting out of market (living longer with parents) there would be a
far more obvious homelessness crisis. It is a good thing there isn’t!
But we’re left with a perception gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who need to believe there is a crisis (because they can stop
construction of required housing in the right places) don’t. This is a
large part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

notes&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;the
history of pregnancy tests! Or things we believe that probably aren't
true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambert's tendency (and to be fair, we all do this a bit) to view the
time of his upbringing as a natural thing to view the future against
runs into problems when we remember the modern age is both quick
changing and often quite weird historically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In any case, home pregnancy tests remove the doctor’s office and
medical lab from the process. In days of yore, the pregnant woman
was not the first to learn of her status ; her doctor’s office
called with the joyous (or confounding) news. Now, only the woman
herself needs know she is with child. This grants her more privacy
and more control. It also transforms what can be a memorable shared
event into a solitary encounter with a plastic stick. The epiphany
occurs in a silo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a culture clash thing, but privacy related to your own
body seems good. The need for a doctor to be involved here at all is
probably historically odd - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2015/05/the_quickening_the_momentous_pregnancy_event_that_became_a_relic.html"&gt;the
quickening&lt;/a&gt;
was fairly private, while deemed legally significant. Mid-twentieth
century isn't 'days of yore'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led&amp;nbsp;to some research on when pregnancy tests started to appear
historically. Various listicles will give&amp;nbsp;you the fact&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;first
pregnancy test recorded was in Egypt in 1350BCE and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/thinblueline/timeline.html"&gt;involved&amp;nbsp;urinating&amp;nbsp;on
barley.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;You'll
then also get told that this isn't actually a bad method! Everywhere I
look has a claim that there was a study in 1963 that found this method
was 70% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a bit suspicious of this. I can't find this 1963 study - I can find
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/12/1/33.full.pdf"&gt;a review in
1966&lt;/a&gt;
that refers to a study&amp;nbsp;in the 1941&amp;nbsp;which&amp;nbsp;found this test gave results
where&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;75% were correctly positive and 85% correctly negative&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't trace it further than this - I can't find a copy of the original
article easily accessibly anywhere.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's possible it's everything the
summary says it is - but we can't be sure. Googling the author and
keywords gives us &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC2603765&amp;amp;blobtype=pdf"&gt;this interesting
summary&lt;/a&gt;
which also expresses doubt on the validity of the Egyptian method as
&amp;quot;human urine may contain plant hormones which stimulate plant
growth,&amp;nbsp;but the level of these hormones does not appear to increase in
pregnancy (pg 19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm sceptical of the whole thing now. Don't trust the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

research is starting to fit very nicely into the final framework (which
hopefully suggests I'm onto something, or alternatively that I've&amp;nbsp;become
blind to contrary information - either/or). Today I read some new
research by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279630540_Crisis_Phones__Suicide_Prevention_Versus_SuggestionContagion_Effects"&gt;Stack
(2015)&lt;/a&gt;
on if crisis phones on bridges were an effective means of suicide
prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he found was a little unsettling.&amp;nbsp;We know people use them (good!)
and that these people tend not to&amp;nbsp;jump (also good!) but did suicides on
the bridge increase or decrease after their installation? They&amp;nbsp;rose. Ah,
but did the population increase? No. Did the local suicide rate increase
as well? No it went down. Ah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack draws attention to a blog that covers bridge suicides (as well as
media coverage) that may be responsible in part for people choosing
bridge suicide over another method. But he also notes&amp;nbsp;(if we believe
that 'suggestion' has influence on suicide) we should look carefully at
those&amp;nbsp;phones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The suggestion thesis holds that the phones, which were installed
with signs alerting suicidal people that they offer a link to help,
will suggest suicide to vulnerable persons. These at-risk
individuals may otherwise not have thought of suicide off the bridge
(Beautrais, 2007; Glatt, 1987). The suggestion hypothesis assumes
that such signs will affect only vulnerable persons at risk of
suicide. It is unlikely that they would impact healthy person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is important - given we generally hold that
at-risk&amp;nbsp;people can be negatively affected by messaging we should
consider this even when intentions are good. &amp;nbsp;Research on other public
health interventions show we cannot rule out that things done in good
faith to save lives will end up doing net harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klimes-Dougan and Lee (2010) did a study on if suicide prevention
billboards were effective - finding negative as well as positive
effects.&amp;nbsp;They found their&amp;nbsp;billboard (&amp;quot;Prevent Suicide, Treat Depression
– See your Doctor&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;) was in general good at getting people to believe
that treating depression was a good way to reduce suicide - but also
that their high-risk group tended to end up with a stronger perceived
link between depression and suicide after viewing a billboard. The worry
here is that being too explicit about the connection to depressed people
encourages a railroading of their future down that path. Their TV ad&amp;nbsp;by
contrast didn't have that effect - it&amp;nbsp;used the phrase &amp;quot;it can even lead
to suicide&amp;quot; as an escalation of symptoms of depression, making death one
of several possible options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billboard group also ended up with lower help-seeking scores than
the no-information group (A TV advert did better however, public health
campaigns not completely doomed) - directly encouraging people to seek
help might not have the results you hope&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here is that&amp;nbsp;this is tricky stuff - the words you use
matter.&amp;nbsp;A workshop on public messages for suicide prevention made the
point that broad campaigns might be bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Broad-based campaigns that are likely to reach multiple audiences
should determine how subgroups of intended populations (or
nontargeted&amp;nbsp;groups of a population) might have different attitudes
about suicide, and may respond differently to messages geared
towards increasing help-seeking behavior (Cauce&amp;nbsp;et al. 2002).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also that targeted campaigns might be bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For example, certain American Indian nations have very high rates of
suicide. A campaign via popular Indian radio stations that
highlights the high prevalence may inadvertently normalize suicide
and send the message that such behaviour is expected and is
inevitable. Groups with high rates may get the message that they
have experienced an expected behaviour, and the groups with lower
rates are simply &amp;quot;lagging behind&amp;quot; on what is seen to be inevitable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say they're just being risk adverse - but we have to
acknowledge that letting words loose into the world with the aim of
saving lives is something we seem to know little about. As Beautrais,
Fergusson, Coogan et al (2007) put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Until there is clear evidence that public health messages about
suicide prevent, and do not normalize, suicide, and have no
deleterious effects, the most prudent approach to this issue is not
to include&amp;nbsp;public health messages as part of a suicide prevention
strategy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to print crisis lines after newspaper articles in suicide
- which are pretty clearly public health messages that are advocated
frequently&amp;nbsp;as part of a suicide prevention strategy. &amp;nbsp; Stack brings up
Niederkrontenthaler et al (2010) who found that newspaper stories that
printed the phone number of a crisis link seemed associated with an
increase in suicide rates. Now for the&amp;nbsp;record, the authors were more
sceptical of this result than some of their others (they were checking
for so many things and it was one of their least significant results -
although still p &amp;lt; 0.05) - but I can't find anyone else who has
suggested anything to the contrary.&amp;nbsp;Others have done research on if
suicide lines are effective on those they reach e.g Gould et al (2007)
(answer: yes-ish - reduction&amp;nbsp;in pain and hopelessness, but not an
apparent&amp;nbsp;reduction in intent to die), there seems to be very little work
on if the advertisement of the lines is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is the population who is exposed to the advertisement
but who will not be exposed to any&amp;nbsp;positive effect of the helpline - if
this group contains at-risk individuals (which it does) then there is
the prospect of harm.&amp;nbsp;That printing a suicide number could be
negative&amp;nbsp;is consistent with research that billboards can have a harmful
effect and the idea that&amp;nbsp;crisis phones on bridges&amp;nbsp;might not be
universally fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certain wordings of these crisis line adverts might be worse than
others is consistent with the idea that suicide contagion is more
powerful when people can identify (and have similarities) with the
subject of the article. If the wording asks you if you identify&amp;nbsp;(&amp;quot;If
you're affected...&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;ooh, am I?&amp;quot;) it might create or intensify a
one-to-one relationship with the subject of the article upon
introspection. This suggests that they shouldn't be viewed as a
corrective or an addendum to the article but part of the text and so
part of any journey of identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There clearly isn't enough evidence to say this is something
papers&amp;nbsp;should stop doing - but I think it's something we need to think
more carefully about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I find it worrying I can create a hypothesis
based on the same theoretical framework the rest of contagion works on
-&amp;nbsp;and that's consistent with the evidence we do have - that says we are
possibly making things worse. &amp;nbsp;Even if we take&amp;nbsp;Niederkrontenthaler et
al.'s scepticism seriously and move their result to the 'not proven'
column it is deeply concerning that we have almost no&amp;nbsp;positive evidence
we can point to and say &amp;quot;printing the phone number makes the suicide
rate go down&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;. The idea&amp;nbsp;that the message can never have a negative
effect on non-callers needs to have more thought put into it to justify
the pre-eminence of this advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stack's main point is that crisis phones are not a good substitute for
barriers on bridges (just much cheaper). It's not clear what a more
effective alternative to crisis line ads following suicide stories would
be. I find the fact that most people who suffer from suicidal thoughts
end up not taking their own life a reassuring idea&amp;nbsp;- a disclaimer built
around this idea encourages identification with the living rather than
the dead (and creates a universe larger than the reader and the subject)
could be an approach to explore. But there's no evidence on if this
would be a good approach&amp;nbsp;or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final section of my project will deal more generally with how little
evidence there is for a lot of suggested interventions - but I wanted to
share a glimpse into just how much of an unknown doing anything
'positive' in this area can be.&lt;/p&gt;

Your Day'. Short: just read the article version - doesn't gain much from
book length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambert's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I ADAPTED THIS term from the 1981 book Shadow Work by Austrian
philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich. For Illich, shadow work
included all the unpaid labor done in a wage-based economy, such as
housework. In a subsistence economy, work directly answers the needs
of life: gathering food, growing crops, building shelters, tending
fires. But once money and wages come into play, we encounter a whole
range of tasks that do not address our basic needs. Instead, such
jobs enable us to earn money to buy necessities and, if possible,
luxuries. That is paid work, not our subject here. This book will
identify and describe the unpaid jobs (like commuting) that an
industrial economy spins off for its citizens. Such jobs go
unnoticed because they take place in the wings of the theater while
we are absorbed in the onstage drama of our lives. They exist in the
shadows. Yet they are every bit as real as anything in the
spotlight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Adapted' is probably the right word - the critique of self-help is a
bit more fierce in in Illich's original. Illich's definition of shadow
work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I call this compliment to wage labour 'shadow work'. It comprises
most housework women do in their homes and apartments, the
activities&amp;nbsp;connected with shopping, most of the homework of students
cramming for exams, the toil&amp;nbsp;expended commuting to and from the job.
It includes the stress of forced consumption, the tedious and
regimented surrender to therapists, compliance&amp;nbsp;with bureaucrats, the
preparation for work to which one is compelled, and many of&amp;nbsp;the
activities usually labelled 'family life'. (p 100)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The false virtue of self-reliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet, unquestionably, it gives us more to do. Minor tasks like
returning our supermarket shopping carts to a holding pen or busing
our own Starbucks tables have become routine. “Why am I doing this?”
asked Daniel, a philosophy professor in western Massachusetts,
wheeling his empty shopping cart to the collection area. “What
happened to those teenagers who used to collect these things? I kind
of liked watching them push about twenty carts, all nested together,
across the parking lot.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sign a few pages in that I'm not necessarily on the same wavelength.
Almost the idea here that tidying up after yourself &amp;nbsp;(and this being
framed as a virtue) is a con so companies don't have to pay people to
clean up after you (and selfish of you because you're denying them
jobs). Possible I'm just socialised into finding that odd but
mechanically, it's only a short jump to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window"&gt;broken window
fallacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Mobility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If these bankers had gone out on hundreds of mortgage appraisals
like my dad did, seeing the actual houses for which they were
lending money and meeting real, live borrowers, would the 2008
banking crisis have happened?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably? I think it's hard to argue that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; bad decisions were ever
made&amp;nbsp;before people put their own trolleys away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But how does an aspiring banker work his way up from the teller’s
window if ATMs and shadow-working customers have displaced tellers?
How does a secretary become the office manager and later an
executive if shadow work eliminates support staff— so there are no
secretaries?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we get to interesting questions about social mobility. I'll come
back to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For those without education and skills, these low-level positions
often are their careers. If such jobs vanish, a throng of unemployed
young people will find themselves with little money and too much
spare time. This is a dangerous development in any society. Unrest
and violence throughout the Arab world have erupted from streets
teeming with young men lacking jobs— angry youths who congregate
online through social media. Such mobs can become unruly. In 2003,
the dissolution of the Iraqi army put 400,000 young men out of work
, triggering a bloody insurgency that still continues. In today’s
global village, where citizens network and congregate in political
flashmobs, we cannot risk creating an immense underclass of idle
youth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-Ba'athification and self-checkouts seem like extreme companions. Is
the issue of this situation no means of support (money can be exchanged
for goods and services) or spare&amp;nbsp;time (Victorians standardise football
to attempt to control spare&amp;nbsp;time, mixed results)? One&amp;nbsp;is better to
intervene in than the other. Are there better solutions than just
maintain rubbish jobs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illich argues that this unpaid work is a necessary shadow component to
allow wage labour to exist at all and comes back to the unpaid work of
women again and again - &amp;quot;The amount of shadow work laid on a person
today is a much better measure of discrimination than&amp;nbsp;bias on the job&amp;quot;(p
101). &amp;nbsp;Lambert takes this to an extent, discussing medical students
where female doctors in training were found to spend far more time
performing household duties compared to their male counterparts but
pulls back from this at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a place for amateur work. Those domestic chores ground you
in daily realities that sometimes go by the name of life. They
connect you with your home, those rooms and furnishings that serve
you without complaint. They bond you to your family, because the
shadow work of housekeeping can be a tangible form of love. The fact
that my mom cooked our meals, washed our clothes, and hung them on a
clothesline to dry—even in winter— and kept our home clean and
orderly, meant so much to my father, sister, brother, and me. Mom
wanted us to have the conditions for a healthy and happy life.
Keeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow work. When
a paid cook, laundress, nanny, or maid does household tasks, the
jobs may be executed very well, but they’re done for a salary, not
from love of family. Inevitably, the work of servants has a
different feeling.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lambert's version of &amp;quot;Shadow Work&amp;quot; is noticeable less biting than
Illich's. If we accept that supermarkets tricking us with 'self
reliance' to do our own checkout is promoting virtue as a con, it's hard
to see how &amp;quot;[k]eeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow
work&amp;quot; is any less so. Shadow work that dents the prospects of men like
his father to work up the ladder is bad, shadow work by women that
enabled his father the time to do that is good. I don't mind a
definition of shadow work where it &amp;quot;just is&amp;quot; rather than being bad
(giving free labour) or good (control and privacy) &amp;nbsp;- but when so much
of the tone of the book is&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;You didn't realise you were doing other
people's jobs for them you sucker&amp;quot; bits like this stick out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The upshot is an army of young people doing full-time shadow work
for months or even years, trying to break into the job market as
unpaid trainees.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say there's a good book about that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The internship juggernaut represents a massive, widespread,
institutionalized form of shadow work. The 2011 exposé Intern
Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New
Economy, by Ross Perlin, offers a biting critique of the internship
explosion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which Lambert has also read, so just go read that. Accept these are
related problems&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;has to be a distinction between consumers taking on
the work of the companies they buy from (doing work that reduces costs
for free) and doing a recognisable job for free (internships). Is a
definition of shadow work that encompasses both actually useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servants and Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United States, we feel a profound ambivalence about receiving
personal service. In this respect, America differs from the Old
World, where monarchs ruled for centuries. Europeans are accustomed
to royalty, nobility, and aristocracies, settled in their palaces
and great mansions with domestic servants. Indeed, hereditary
monarchs still sit on thrones in Britain, Spain, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Europe has long lived
with an entrenched class structure that included a servant class
waiting on their “betters.” Consequently, Old World cultures feel a
degree of comfort with personal service.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is at best simplistic. Lucy Lethbridge's&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;'Servants: A Downstairs
View of Twentieth-century Britain&lt;/em&gt;' has an excellent running thread on
the aristocracy slowly learning to do things themselves. For a bit more
historical background on how changes in available labour and funds led
the upper-class to &amp;quot;shadow-work&amp;quot; read that (although &amp;quot;Hey what were the
rich up to?&amp;quot; is not the point of the book).&amp;nbsp;Small snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Concessions were made towards slightly smaller numbers of household
staff but also to a generation that had begun to enjoy some
independence and was not quite as deficient in practical skills as
its parents’ generation had been. Breakfasts in grand houses, for
example, became increasingly self-service, the dishes arranged on
the sideboard&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing the historical picture into it is exactly what a book on
&amp;quot;shadow work&amp;quot; should do (and what Illich does at length with the rise of
wage labour). Is &amp;quot;Removing entry level work reduces social mobility&amp;quot;
just a modern variation of &amp;quot;but how will people become butlers if there
are less entry level servant jobs?&amp;quot; If not, why not? What lessons does
the decline of servants have for the decline of a service-economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also&amp;nbsp;Lambert's assertion that tipping is an Americanism resulting from
an unease to personal service is obviously&amp;nbsp;ahistorical. It's not only a
European import but was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12tipping-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=0&amp;amp;hp"&gt;resisted by
Americans&lt;/a&gt;
at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dating&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the book is pretty clearly padding to reach the word
limit, but by extending the concept to dating it completely falls apart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, people met dating partners through family and
friends, at work, or through hobbies and social events. Today,
various businesses also facilitate linking up. Professional
matchmakers introduce their clients for a fee. Printed or online
personal ads, singles groups and events (not just drinking and
dancing but singles yoga classes, cycling trips, and gardening
clubs), and “speed dating” help make connections. The fact that
these businesses exist testifies that traditional ways of meeting
are no longer getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]Dating-site questionnaires probe views and preferences to build
personality profiles. The data archive that shadow-working customers
create for free becomes (like Facebook’s content) a valuable capital
asset that the sites can monetize. In one sense, providing this data
is just the obvious ante: You have to pony up information to play
the game. On the other hand, it’s a task that does not arise when
people meet via real social networks rather than virtual ones. In
this way it qualifies as shadow work, as the dating site puts it in
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]Late-night OkCupid work can mean sleeping less and finding
yourself increasingly fatigued by the shadow work of dating.
“Typically I would send messages back and forth via the site three
times before one of us would suggest exchanging cell phone numbers
to arrange a meeting,” Rachel says. “Once I had someone’s number I
would probably exchange another three text messages to decide on a
place and time and confirm meeting up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really, really pushing it. If &amp;quot;talking to people&amp;quot; is shadow-work
literally anything that involves effort is now shadow-work. Is this
unpaid work that makes wage labour possible? Is it even self-servicing
what used to be done by wage labour? If we accept that amateur labour
(doing work that others would be paid for) counts as shadow-work, then
people match-making their friends is shadow-work because they're doing
work that people are paying online sites to do.&amp;nbsp;The concept as Lambert
uses it means absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;arguing
the problems of rent control was going round twitter yesterday in
response to Miliband rent control proposals in the UK. Ignoring the fact
the Miliband's rent control is a controlled-rise system rather the the
traditional set-up Krugman attacks, anyone who finds his San Francisco
example scary doesn't really understand the current problems in the
housing market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, consider an article that appeared in yesterday's
New York Times, ''In San Francisco, Renters Are Supplicants.'' It
was an interesting piece, with its tales of would-be renters
spending months pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate
applicants arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress
the landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something
crucial missing -- specifically, two words I knew had to be part of
the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I have any special knowledge about San Francisco's housing
market -- in fact, as of yesterday morning I didn't know a thing
about it. But it was immediately obvious from the story what was
going on. To an economist, or for that matter a freshman who has
taken Economics 101, everything about that story fairly screamed
those two words -- which are, of course, ''rent control.''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the sort of landlord behavior described in the article --
demanding that prospective tenants supply resumes and credit
reports, that they dress nicely and act enthusiastic -- &lt;strong&gt;doesn't
happen in uncontrolled housing markets&lt;/strong&gt; [emphasis&amp;nbsp;mine]. Landlords
don't want groveling -- they would rather have money. In
uncontrolled markets the question of who gets an apartment is
settled quickly by the question of who is able and willing to pay
the most. And so I had no doubts about what I would find after a bit
of checking -- namely, that San Francisco is a city where a
technology-fueled housing boom has collided with a draconian
rent-control law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to be too scared by this doomsday vision of prospective
tenants at the mercy of strange landlord demands because this is pretty
close to what I've actually experienced. I've &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/invasive-referencing/"&gt;written about it
before&lt;/a&gt;
but one place we almost moved the landlord, despite the fact the letting
agent would do a reference check, demanded to see bank statements and
have a meeting with us before accepting our offer. &amp;nbsp;This wasn't a
friendly&amp;nbsp;meeting, it was&amp;nbsp;an aggressive &amp;quot;how do I know you won't leave
early&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;how stable are your jobs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;you don't have friends and parties
right&amp;quot; meeting.&amp;nbsp;You got the impression quickly he was of the &amp;quot;unexpected
visit&amp;quot; school of bad landlords and having come from another bad landlord
situation we got the deposit back and moved into another place. Here we
spent the next year dealing with mould, rats, mice and cockroaches, but
the choice&amp;nbsp;we made was absolutely the right one. That would not have
been a good landlord to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can't be dismissed as &amp;quot;just one creep&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;Looking at bank statements
is a practice defended on landlord forums because of the &amp;quot;risk&amp;quot;
landlords take by being landlords.&amp;nbsp;Another place wasn't even interested
in renting a two double-bedroom place to a group of three because they
were looking for &amp;quot;professionals&amp;quot; rather than people who knew each other
- essentially they wanted people with few connections who would treat
the place as a dormitory&amp;nbsp;rather than a place to be lived or socialised
in&amp;nbsp;(with the &amp;quot;risks&amp;quot; that might entail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But London doesn't have rent control - if the landlord had so many
offers that they could afford to be picky why don't they just raise the
price? Don't they just want money? The way to make sense of this is&amp;nbsp;that
the wrong people operate the private rental sector. In 2010 &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf"&gt;a private
landlord&amp;nbsp;survey&lt;/a&gt;
found that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eighty-nine per cent of landlords were private individual landlords
responsible for 71% of all private rented dwellings, with a further
5% of landlords being company landlords responsible for 15% of
dwellings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More than three quarters (78%) of all landlords only owned a single
dwelling for rent, with only 8% of landlords stating they were full
time landlords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-scale landlords are the major player in the rental sector and
they're not always going to be good capitalists. The ones that act like
the above&amp;nbsp;are risk-adverse and want their investment bothering them as
little as possible.&amp;nbsp;If the amount of money you are willing to accept to
balance the greater perceived risk is greater&amp;nbsp;than the difference
between the price where you have one buyer and and the price where you
have enough choice to chose less risky tenants, you will charge less
than you can and screen. &amp;nbsp;People who will put up with this before even
moving in are likely to be less troublesome, less likely to make demands
of work that cost money/require attention, less likely to understand
their legal situation, etc. This is a better and more comfortable
position for the investor-landlord.&amp;nbsp;The rate of return&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996"&gt;is still
ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people say that rent control means that properties&amp;nbsp;won't be
maintained and landlords will have invasive and offensive tests of
potential tenants I'm not scared of rent control - I'm scared people
don't seem to understand the full extent of the problem. We clearly&amp;nbsp;do
not live&amp;nbsp;a housing market where tenants are only discriminated against
on the size of the wallets - when your uncontrolled situation is pretty
close to the controlled bogeyman something has gone very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2015/01/if-you-believe-trans-lives-matter-dont-share-leelah-alcorns-suicide-note-social"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;went
up on The New Statesman today arguing&amp;nbsp;that people sharing the suicide
note of a trans-person were actually endangering the very people they
were trying to raise awareness of. This is&amp;nbsp;based on The Samaritans
guidelines&amp;nbsp;that journalists should&amp;nbsp;not print the content of suicide
notes because of the idea of 'suicide contagion' - arguing that
including details of suicide notes can make it more likely people will
try and emulate the note's author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion of the Samaritan’s guidelines is
they offer&amp;nbsp;good generalised advice that should be read and often
followed. That said, specific guidance is often detached from supporting
evidence and shouldn't be used as an authority to beat people with.
There are circumstances where blindly following guidance has the
potential to do harm and I think this is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why the contagious understanding of the suicide note is a
bit narrow we need to know a bit more history. I go into this in far
more detail in the finished piece but my basic premise is that over the
last few centuries’ media coverage of suicide played a significant part
in making us a better, kinder&amp;nbsp;society&amp;nbsp;more understanding of
those&amp;nbsp;amongst us most in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quickly summarise historian Michael MacDonald’s argument [1] -
newspapers secularised suicide by making it a mundane fact of life. The
syndication of suicide stories made the fact of suicide a constant
low-level noise as opposed to something that would happen in smaller
communities incredibly infrequently. From stories of the devil stalking
the earth and taking lives, suicide was enveloped in statistical
reporting. Coverage was often (but not universally) sympathetic. The
focus on the stories of individuals and a large written audience for
stories about suicide created the literary genre of the suicide note
(sometimes helped along&amp;nbsp;by journalists providing them when absent).
Through these notes people tried to shape the narrative of their death
for their community and the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In step with these developments came near total resistance to sanctions
for the deceased or their survivors, which led to subsequent law
changes. Naturally social change was more complicated than that but the
role of newspapers was important. They made the reader’s world bigger
and the quietest voices louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from that history I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is
always wrong to print suicide notes and that no good can come of
reporting suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a reason given in the Samaritans guide as to why suicide
notes shouldn’t be reported, but working from the general theory
of&amp;nbsp;suicide contagion the fear is that it risks increasing identification
with the deceased and identification might lead to&amp;nbsp;imitation. I dislike
the view that suicide notes should only be seen as infectious spores.
They might also be the last way to understand a person&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the evidence for suicide contagion exists (more patchy than often
stated, but still worth taking seriously) this doesn’t apply to all
guidelines proposed. Restrictions on printing suicide method are well
evidenced, most other areas are more theoretical (and I suspect often
derive from backwards engineering terrible reporting – printing suicide
notes is in most cases tacky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small scientific field concerned with analysing suicide notes
but there is very little published on their effect on suicide contagion.
Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues[2] did investigate if citing a suicide
note effected suicide rates but found no effect – and this lack of
outcome merited no discussion. It’s just not a particular active
question in the field. The only area where a suicide note was discussed
at length I can find was an instance where releasing extracts from a
suicide note was seen as positive. I don’t buy this but it’s worth
looking at to understand solid ground is very hard to find here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of suicide contagion is best established with celebrity
suicides (Stack’s 2005 meta-analysis of the literature found no
ecological effect on suicide rates had been definitively proven outside
of celebrity studies[3]). As such after Kurt Cobain’s suicide there were
a few attempts to detect an effect in suicide rates. These failed to
find an effect (which is a good thing), and the explanations given for
this in the literature are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin, Graham. “Media Influence to Suicide : The Search for Solutions.”
Archives of Suicide Research 4, no. 1 (2007): 51–66:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One major difference appears to be the attitude actively promoted by
Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, by his family and subsequently by the
media. Immediately following the death Love made an audiotape
containing excerpts from a note left by Cobain; she commented in a
negative fashion on each part (Gaines, 1994, p. 107). For instance;
“I don’t have the passion anymore, so remember – (And don’t, because
this is a f…ing lie) – It’s better to burn out than fade away (God,
you asshole.) (Sandford, 1995, p.244)”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gould, M S. “Suicide and the Media.” Annals of the New York Academy of
Sciences 932 (April 2001): 200–214 :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet, celebrity suicides do not always yield imitative suicides, as
evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in suicides
following the death of Kurt Cobain. [...] [T]he substantial efforts
by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, to present his suicide in a
negative fashion may have counteracted any potential glamorization
of his death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument essentially goes “there was no imitative effect, therefore
the response did something right”, yet I suspect if you asked Martin if
we should be printing but dismantling suicide notes he wouldn’t argue
for that forcefully. This argument is grasping at straws a little and
paints an overly progressive picture of the media response to Cobain’s
death. If it really was a good response we might need to change media
guides more. After all, the Seattle Times printed a front page image of
Cobain's dead body&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/126631/how-seattle-times-covered-cobains-death-17-years-ago-today/#more-126631"&gt;the next
day&lt;/a&gt;on the grounds that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[T]his picture met that test by establishing an essential reality
about Cobain’s death. Our concern was that Cobain’s suicide would be
romanticized by some – suicide, the ultimate high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one editor said, the photo showed, ‘This wasn’t cool, it was
death and that’s the result of suicide.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, media guides would advise against such a thing but they’re
essentially working from the same hymn sheet that you shouldn’t glorify
the dead. Why are the Samaritans right and the Seattle Times wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to dismantle the idea of expert opinion a bit here. I don’t think
anyone has any particularly good evidence why there was no detectable
effect after Cobain's suicide and I don’t think anyone has any evidence
that you shouldn’t print suicide notes. I trust well-intentioned people
working at charities trying to save lives a little more than I trust
well-intentioned people who also like to sell newspapers, but simply
having the right&amp;nbsp;intentions is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this situation; we have two sets of well-intentioned people – one
set want to bring wider light to a story in the hope of saving lives,
the other set think this is dangerous because telling this story could
kill more people. This is important stuff, who is right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the key questions. The Samaritans explicitly state their
guidelines are only advisory;&amp;nbsp;has&amp;nbsp;suicide contagion been demonstrated to
such an&amp;nbsp;extent that there can be no exceptions to guidance? I'd argue
not. Is there any evidence suggesting suicide notes in particular cause
harm? Again, the answer's no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means, be concerned - but let's not pretend anyone knows which
course of action saves more lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side point, but after The Samaritans’ &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users"&gt;Radar controversy&lt;/a&gt; worth thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking on this hasn't solidified yet, but there’s a touch of a
paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill in the advice not to
print suicide notes. We’re told “avoid the suggestion that a single
incident […] was the cause” - after all suicide is complicated and often
involves mental illness - but also not to report why they said they did
it. The implication here is that these people were not qualified to tell
you why they were suffering. This is even more unsettling when written
by a member of a group who specifically highlights their treatment as
part of that group: “They can’t know what they’re talking about, they’re
ill.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;I think this is accepted uncritically a bit wider than it should
be.&lt;/p&gt;

of English Newspapers to 1899' (#booksthatgooglegivesyoudirectionsfor)
is a fantastic guide to the development of English newspapers but
importantly also&amp;nbsp;very funny. &amp;nbsp;Clarke has a gift for bringing some of the
more absurd features of the early profession.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was Grub Street?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Grub Street is a metaphor for the hack writer. The word ‘hack’
derives from Hackney, originally meaning a horse for hire and later
a prostitute, a woman for hire. Finally, it was applied to a writer
for hire, a newspaper writer or a literary drudge. Paid by the line,
scratching a precarious living from the lower reaches of literature,
including journalism, the Grub Street hack received no public
acclaim, other than the sneers and jibes&amp;nbsp;of his more successful
contemporaries who, by a mixture of ability and sycophancy,
had&amp;nbsp;found the security of a patron.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Newspaper Corrections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely one of the best newspaper correction in history belongs to the
Reading Mercury in 1765 - as provincial papers would print pages as news
came in during the week they could end up with corrections on page 2 for
content on page 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page 1 - The following melancholy accident, we are informed,
happened on Friday last, at a principal Inn on the road to Reading,
viz. As a Gentleman was going up stairs he met the Landlady coming
down, when he insisted upon a kiss, which she complied with; but the
Gentleman not content with that, attempted to put his hand into her
bosom, which she resented, and pushing him from her, he
unfortunately fell down the stairs, broke his neck, and expired soon
after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page 3 -The story propagated about town (and which is inserted in
the former part of this paper) of a Gentleman attempting too great a
freedom with the Landlady of a great Inn on the road to Reading, and
that she pushed him down stairs, whereby he was killed, is without
any sort of foundation, no such circumstances having happened or
been attempted; but is supposed to arise from envy; on account of
the great resort of genteel company to the said Inn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The wonderful reason 'The Times' is 'The Times'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was founded by John Walter as the Daily&amp;nbsp;Universal Register in
1785. Because the title was so long, people tended to ask for ‘the
Register’, and were likely to end with the Weekly Register, or the
Annual Register, or even Harris’s Register, the list of Covent
Garden whores. So in 1788 Walter remained his paper The Times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some traditions started early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Finally, there was the series of semi-pornographic newsbooks
produced by John Crouch: The Man in the Moon (1649-50), Mercurius
Democritus (1625-43); and Mercurius Fumigosus (1654-55), which
contained a mixture of genuine news and dirty jokes disguised as
news.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded Journalists (or chaplains) in the Prison System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Fuller accounts were to be found in the threepenny or sixpenny
broadsheets of Dying Confessions that were hawked about the street
after, and sometimes during, the execution. Many of these were the
work of the Ordinary or Chaplain of Newgate. The Ordinary would try
to obtain a full account of the life and crimes of the prisoner in
the condemned cell under the pretense that the prisoner ought to
confess all his sins to make his peace with God. If that did not
work, he would travel in the cart with the condemned&amp;nbsp;man from
Newgate to try and wring some serviceable copy out of him.
Naturally&amp;nbsp;the publicity value would not be so great if the prisoner
was reprieved. The Rev. James Villette once tried to prevent
the&amp;nbsp;last-minute reprive of a fifteen-year-old boy by telling the
hangman&amp;nbsp;to get on with it, as it was too late to worry about such
details.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is well worth the read if you ever find yourself with a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;

electoral registration page -
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rentersvote.co.uk/"&gt;rentersvote.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought behind this: I had problems voting this May which I've gone into
more detail on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/only-56-of-private-renters-are-registered-to-vote/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;(short&amp;nbsp;story:
moved late, was registered, administrative screw-up, couldn't vote - but
long story is more fun) and I've been thinking about the problem of
renters and elections in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gulf in registration rates between private renters and homeowners is
huge (56 % vs 87%) - the political process is vastly weighted in favour
of current homeowners for various reasons but this&amp;nbsp;bit&amp;nbsp;seems like a
fairly tackle-able handicap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registration drives are not really a thing in the UK (while being huge
in the US), the annual canvass&amp;nbsp;does a fairly good job at finding people
who are in the same place year after year - but is terrible at finding
the renters who are in a different place each time (data matching
experiments have been equally unpromising for renters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new online voter registration system is a massive improvement on the
previous way you had to register out of cycle (which to remind you: you
had to print off a pdf, write down all your stuff, post it, where
someone else would re-type it in) - this is now a five minute job
anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives a point of an entry for a sectional registration drive. A
scheme targeted at getting private renters on the register should be
able to make an impact on that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a digital divide issue that'll need to be addressed at some
point (registrations forms are still printable and I created a very
basic flyer as an intermediary thing) but as digital is easier and the
hole in renter registration has a lot of young people who (technically)
use the internet there's a lot of scope in digital before needing to
expand offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase in renter registration would need to be converted
into&amp;nbsp;greater salience for renter-friendly policies, but that's a
slightly harder problem.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a already a fine start - that's already an excellent name to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of him as a proto-Flashheart is doubtless exaggerated (that said when he met&amp;nbsp;his wife &amp;quot;she was 18 and he was 24 and had been engaged twice before&amp;quot;) - but according to the legend he not only discovered&amp;nbsp;a German spy disguised as an army padre by noticing&amp;nbsp;he was wearing the wrong number of pips, but rode a motorcycle through the trenches to save a friend’s girl from a nunnery threatened by the German advance. That one has it all really - solid story. Less on message, he caught typhoid fever - but recovered and survived the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His brother was less lucky. Harry Parsons died in an air raid in 1917 - an unlikely
way to go, only around 1,500 died because of raids in the entire war.
There’s a story passed down that he died wandering into the street to
get a better look at the Zeppelins, as it happens there are accounts of
people in London doing exactly this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;Raids hadn't become a very serious thing and everybody crowded out
into the street to watch. They didn't take cover or dodge.&amp;quot; Lt
Charles Chabot, 39 Squadron RFC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry wasn't one of them. As newspaper archives were
opened up my dad found what had been published at the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Henry Over Parsons, 33, violinist [...] According to Superintendent
Woolger, a fire brigade officer, the back part of the house was
demolished and the whole house of 18 rooms more or less damaged by
the explosion. A section of Royal Engineers found the body. The bed
appeared to have been turned right over and twisted into a most
fantastic shape. Deceased was thrown from the bed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story about wandering into the street is
interesting, the report of this inquest is attached in the several
places it was syndicated with another where the coroner did mark people
going to look out their open doors as a contributor to their deaths. This possibly explains how
how this idea came into family legend. But there
were also direct experiences of the next generation that would colour
telling of the strange Great War bombings. Reginald was called up again in the
Second World War and during the Battle of Britain was &amp;quot;standing on a
balcony [with another officer] watching an aerial dogfight overhead when
a spent cannon shell hit the other man, killing him.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;My grandfather
described his own memories of air-raids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In September 1940 we were staying temporarily on our home in Acton.
I remember watching dockland burning on the night of September 7.
Every night for some weeks we slept under the kitchen table, pushed
under the staircase for further protection. I remember Brian, who
was 9, saying during one very noisy air raid, 'Mummy, I don't want
to die.' It could easily have happened. A bomb dropped in the front
garden of the house directly opposite us, but the blast went the
other way and our house was hardly damaged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these you can see how&amp;nbsp;the naivety&amp;nbsp;of someone wanting to look could
become attached to a convenient&amp;nbsp;relative. In general going into the
street says something about the period we want to be true -&amp;nbsp;it reflects
how we retrospectively see the First World War. Bombers over London were
an intrusion of the ugly twentieth century on a world that didn't know
it was coming. We want them to be drawn to the novelty, like a child
playing with a brightly coloured snake. We want to offer them&amp;nbsp;a moment
of realisation, to&amp;nbsp;understand if nothing else, before that innocence is
lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's rare we're given that chance. It becomes clear only in retrospect when one world is over and another begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another distant uncle (as so many of these stories involve by necessity)
William Pullen died in the Somme. On school trips to the battlefields my
siblings and I would look for his name. When they found the collection
of soldiers’ wills last year I requested a copy of his. He left all his
possessions to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more to say about Harry aside &amp;quot;he died&amp;quot; - some happy, much sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a gifted musician from a family of musicians. He goes to study at the Royal Academy of Music and while he's there he meets a girl, Jessie, who he performed in a duo with for several years before they get married (newspaper reports of these performances are a reminder that not only sad things are documented). They have a daughter together - and here is where things start to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what was either an exasperation of a long-standing problem or else a sudden change he becomes deeply unwell - both delusional and depressed. He goes home to Wales, but his mother can't handle caring for both her mentally disabled daughter (Elsie) and her increasingly manic and violent son - so she commits him to a local asylum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months there their daughter dies and Harry is checked out by his father (his absence from the family home suggests he may have away with Jessie and the baby). The discharge says he's 'unimproved' and he's back in within six months. He spends the next three years in the asylum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He slowly improves. He starts eating more, the doctors note he's happier when playing the piano.  Eventually he leaves the asylum. He moves back to London and starts teaching the violin again. Within a year his house explodes and he dies being thrown from his bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Elsie would also be committed to the asylum as her parents became less able to care for her. She died inside of an epileptic fit after never speaking a word in her life. The family stayed in touch with Jessie, my granddad writes about meeting her.&lt;/p&gt;

and journalism. &amp;nbsp;It contains description of suicide&amp;nbsp;methods only in so
far as they are required to demonstrate the point being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a number of countries there are media guidelines on suicide
reporting (most voluntary, but New Zealand’s are governed by law). These
arrived in the UK in 2006 when the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)
added a new clause to the Editors’ Code of Practice, extending the
guidelines on reporting on topics likely to involve personal grief with
an explicit prohibition on publishing ‘excessive detail’ about suicide
methods. The article now reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;5. Intrusion into grief or shock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and
approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication
handled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report
legal proceedings, such as inquests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii) When reporting suicide, care should be taken to avoid excessive
detail about the method used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rule has now been in effect for eight years and there have now been
sufficient cases to make determinations on what exactly this rule has
meant in practice. How have complaints turned out? What exactly is
‘excessive’ detail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been forty-six complaints under this clause - most complaints
are brought by relatives of the deceased, with a small number being
triggered by suicide prevention organisations&amp;nbsp;or elected officials. In
one case the PCC itself brought the complaint against
fourteen&amp;nbsp;newspapers over the same story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many complaints are resolved with an apology or a voluntary redaction of
their online archive by the newspaper - but in some cases the PCCs
reasoning over what level of detail is or isn’t ‘excessive’ becomes
clearer. Examining all rulings involving 5.ii, I found that the PCC to
date have chosen to interpret it as a rule against popularizing or
explaining unusual or technical methods of suicide. Details tend to be
allowed when the method can in some sense be seen as ‘obvious’. To use
specific cases, it is wrong to tell people how many pills are a fatal
dose or how a suicide involving a balloon kit was accomplished but it is
acceptable to describe someone as having hung themselves with their
shoelaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of hanging (a minority of PCC complaints but the most common
method of suicide in the UK), the PCC has repeated argued the material
used to perform the act does not constitute part of the method. In the
very first complaint under 5.ii it was argued
[&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA=="&gt;http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NDMzMA==&lt;/a&gt;] that the
inclusion of a “photograph taken from the centre’s CCTV footage of [a
man] walking towards a stairwell with a bed sheet tied around his neck”
was not excessive as the rule was ‘designed to prevent the inclusion of
detail in newspaper reports that might provoke ‘copycat’ suicides. The
inclusion of a photograph of the complainant’s father before his death
did not raise an issue under this part of the Code.’ Similarly, in 2011
[&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ=="&gt;http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=NzM5OQ==&lt;/a&gt;] a complaint
that about including the fact that someone had hung ‘himself with
shoelaces’ was included in the headline was rejected, arguing that “the
article had only referred to the material with which the complainant had
hanged himself. The Commission found that the reference under complaint
did not represent an excessive detail such that would represent a breach
of the Code.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCC also rejected a complaint in 2008 that inclusion of a picture of
a noose in a story about suicides in Bridgend was an excessive amount of
detail - “It had to have regard to the fact that – regrettably – there
had been a spate of deaths by hanging, and that this fact was
well-known. The picture of the noose did not make public anything new
about the deaths, or describe the actual process by which individuals
had used particular materials to take their own lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is a problem because contrary to the idea that everybody
already knows how to hang themselves, information about exact hanging
techniques varies and even minor details can change how attractive the
idea of hanging is to a person. Biddle et al. [1] conducted a study with
people who had attempted suicide explicitly aimed at finding out why
they did or didn’t choose hanging as a method. People who tried hanging
believed it would be quick, easy and could be done with materials to
hand. People who did not believed it would be slow, painful or that they
lacked the technical know-how or rope to make the noose. This last point
is especially important, for hanging object is method - this is
information that change the desirability of the method. The PCC fixation
on technical or pharmaceutical suicides misses the purpose of the rule -
the concealment of unnecessary elements that might change the likelihood
someone puts into practice a given method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown earlier [in not published sections], method and suicidal intent
is highly interlinked - restricting methods (either through physical
restrictions or by creating ignorance) is the most effective way of
having an effect on suicide across a society. This is the area where the
scientific evidence is most certain and if journalists can be convinced
of this solitary point it would account for most of the effect any wider
restrictions would give. The PCC (or its successor body) needs to take
into scope ‘obvious’ suicide methods and descriptions that might make
them more salient in the mind of a reader. These are after all the most
common and so an area where efforts would be likely to have the most
impact.&lt;/p&gt;

read? But you can if you want. I'm not your dad or
anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gone Home, only one thing really happens. You read letters, you put
tapes into cassette players, gain access to parts of the house initially
locked off, but there is only one action you take that causes the world
to change irrevocably (and while effective, it’s a bit of a cheat
really). I think this more than anything gives a feel for the kind of
game this is, one based around reflective discovery rather than action.
The world is interactive, but only really transforms in the sense that
your understanding of it changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s backtrack and set the scene: It’s a dark and stormy night in
1995, player character Katie has been travelling round Europe and has
now returned home - only her family has moved and now the family house
is a place she’s never been, a house where they never finished
unpacking, where items from different eras and lives lie alongside each
other. A house where no one’s home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You make your way through the house, gradually turn on the lights and
encounter the artifacts of your family’s life while you were away. As
the game progresses, three different but interconnected stories become
apparent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Young love blooming - the story of younger sister Sam falling in love
and discovering her sexual identity - told explicitly at the player
through voiceover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marriage on the rocks - All has not been well for Katie’s parents
while she’s been away, their professional lives are on different
tracks and personally they’re drifting apart - learned through
correspondence with third parties scattered through the house.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buried family history - Katie’s father Terrance was abused by his
uncle Oscar in this house -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better"&gt;&amp;nbsp;discoverable only from inference from
the artifacts around the
house&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thread is arguably the main story, the game ‘finishes’
(credits roll but you can still return to the house) when this story
reaches it’s end but what’s neat is it’s actually possible to get right
through the game without getting much of the third story at all. It
takes a lot of self-confidence to essentially hide so much of a story
that feeds into it’s other threads - making discovery of that story an
internal experience for the player - ‘show, don’t tell’ taken to an
extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most prominent way the story is told is through the voice-over of
extracts from Sam's journal - which in the initial entry we're told she
is using as a substitute for her normal conversations with Katie and so
is structured as a series of letters to the player character. The
distinction between player and character in the game has been most
looked at with the time the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://deadpixel.co/2013/08/not-gonna-happen/"&gt;character puts down and won't pick up
again&lt;/a&gt; a diary entry
where Sam describes her first sexual experience with her girlfriend
(Katie’s ‘voice’ in the story is otherwise only really ‘heard’ through
the hover-over description she gives certain items) but to me the most
important distinction is the player is hearing these voice-overs,
contextualising objects with a history - Katie is not. Katie doesn't
come into possession of the letters until the last second of the game -
until that point the player has much more knowledge of what’s going on
than she does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually also throws the diary entry into a different light -
without the voice-overs to guide us through the nascent relationship
Katie has a very different set of information to the player. She is
given a few visual hints that her sister is gay (a men's magazine in her
locker earns a 'oh my' label) and that there's a interestingly prominent
girl in her life, but this is I believe the first time Katie learns that
the relationship is romantic/sexual. We also have no idea exactly what
Katie's opinion of her sister's sexuality is. Katie is more
'conventional' than her sister - she actually answered the question on
her sex ed paper unlike Sam's (amazing) short story on the subject. The
player, eighteen years later on the far side of 'don't ask/don't tell'
(which is a period detail now!) and primed by hearing the story of young
love in Sam's own voice, might well be be feeling much more comfortable
with this than Katie is in that moment. We simply don't know. The player
character is going through an emotional journey at a very different rate
to the player and there's an interesting possibility of dissonance
there. Similarly in the final movement from cupboard under the stairs to
the attic, the player has been primed by the voiceover to expect
something very different to what Katie might be thinking - did you run?
Would Katie have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the genre demands the house is riddled with secret passages and
hidden doors (mostly justified, the passages all make sense as giving
servants access to certain parts of the house without crossing the main
spaces). As the story is essentially structured geographically,
staggering access to these passages allows for something open plan (a
house) to be re-funneled into a mostly linear story.&amp;nbsp;This isn’t just
used as a structure convenience, creeping around these poorly lit
passages is used to put you in the world of the several different sets
of characters have also used these passages - creeping behind the
acceptable history and ideas of the family. Sam and her girlfriend use
the passages for privacy, but there’s also the inference that the
passage to the guest room is how uncle Oscar got his nephew from the
second floor down to the recesses off the basement undetected (to
reinforce this, an artifact of Oscar is found underneath the door frame
at the top of the passage, while an artifact of Terrance is found in the
cupboard at the end of the route in the basement- a path connected by
objects out of place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about how &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://iam.benabraham.net/2013/08/gone-home-jump-scares-and-ludonarative-harmony/"&gt;Gone Home plays with and subverts
horror
tropes&lt;/a&gt;
- there’s the light-bulb that coincidently breaks the moment the player
examines a creepy object (the ‘one action’ I’m talking about in the
first paragraph) but there’s also the the blood-stained bath with the...
oh, hair dye bottle next to it. One particular way the game mixes mood
and game design to create a storytelling moment is so simple it’s
genius. Coming out of the basement there’s a staircase with a pipe
running along the ceiling, as you move up the stairs the way a section
of the pipe breaks against the light at the top of the stairs gives the
illusion (as the shape of the section cutting off the light changes) of
a figure moving at the top. So far, so creepy - but this staircase is
along that path from guest bedroom to basement and once you've got the
idea of a shadowy figure moving up those stairs your brain is engaged
(even after you realise it’s just a pipe) and you might wonder why, if
there was one, a shadowy figure might be taking that particular route -
a clue to help you twig aspects of the Oscar story. Possible I'm
over-reading into that, but the possibility of story-telling through
optical illusion is a nifty thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting little meta-commentary about the game’s use of
horror game conventions in the change in Terrance’s novels over time. In
the basement there’s a note from Terrance’s father, an english lit
scholar commending him on publication of his sci-fi novel but commenting
harshly that the book is bound by cliché and genre conventions - a
phrase from this letter &amp;quot;You can do better&amp;quot; is recreated on big sheets
of paper in the office (you discover these in the opposite order,
transforming the faintly pathetic mantra into a deeply depressing one as
you find the source).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the story Terrance’s confidence has been revitalised and
he has after twenty years completed another novel in his time-travel
series- described as more introspective (where the hero doesn't save the
President's life but his own!) - trying to finally live up to his dad's
instruction to complete himself as an artist by turning inward, but in a
way that rejects the idea that it is the genre conventions that were
holding him back. I see this as a comment on ‘Gone Home’ itself and the
idea that video games can only become ‘art’ if they ditch the
conventions of their more populist output. The game does neat things in
part because the world it creates is so aware of genre expectations and
sees their inclusion (and subversion) as a way to deepen the experience
it creates. An introspective novel with a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;

Caprica,&amp;nbsp;Buffy, Doctor Who, Red Dwarf - but you know, read it anyway.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point does it become wrong to want to change the way things are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is natural to want this at the heart of so many stories is the
idea that at some point trying to change the universe becomes unhealthy
and&amp;nbsp;monstrous. Anxiety in this mould about technological progress has
been a feature of science fiction since the beginning - but anxiety
about technological progress&amp;nbsp;isn't&amp;nbsp;really about technology, what
‘science is bad’ is really saying is that people are bad and that the
ability science gives us to control our own destiny will distort and
twist us in the most fundamental ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Mirror definitely buys into this relationship between the bad
people and their toys. &lt;em&gt;The National Anthem&lt;/em&gt; argues that modern
technology is bringing us closer to animals rather than lifting us above
(although I’m not convinced the story &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/12/black-mirror-the-media-and-the-mob/"&gt;pulled off the mob aspect that
well&lt;/a&gt;),
&lt;em&gt;The Entire History of You&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Be Right Back&lt;/em&gt; share a theme that the
imperfection of memory is a blessing that keeps us from living in the
past and technology that allows us to re-experience things we’ve lost
keeps us from growing as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be Right Back&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;deals with Martha, who after the death of her husband
(Ash) is signed up to a internet start-up that given access to the
social media profiles of the dead can recreate their personality, given
voice samples can call you on the phone, and given photos (plus money)
can send you a robot to take their place. This shares a lot of DNA with
the Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica, where a major set of plot
threats are various character’s ambitions for protagonist Zoe’s (who
‘dies’ in the first episode) resurrection&amp;nbsp;computer program. Like &lt;em&gt;Be
Right Back&lt;/em&gt;, Caprica’s method of resurrection is based on the equivalent
of scouring social networks and the internet but in Caprica’s case this
is actually good enough and the end results are effectively perfect
copies of the original people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Be Right Back&lt;/em&gt; Robot Ash’s presence is harmful because he
simply&amp;nbsp;isn't&amp;nbsp;a good enough copy to replace the original, what was meant
to displace grief ends up extending it. Caprica looks more towards the
social fallout of the possible end of death. From Clarice’s plans to
create a heaven for martyrs of her religion to Daniel’s plans to sell
the technology and make it available widely (complete with promo video
of a man stepping out from behind his coffin to his grieving family)
there is no doubt that the technology works, simply how it is going to
be used. Robot Ash is flawed because the story model requires a fatal
flaw (like these &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/"&gt;great tales of caveman science
fiction&lt;/a&gt;).
Using technology (or magic) to address your desires (resulting from
ambition, grief) will only create monsters - either figurative or
literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that’s fun with these kind of stories is to think about how
the possible future society that’s got over these issues will look back
on them. If you could be resurrected from your social networks and it
could be perfect - would this be wrong? Would resurrection really be so
bad for us as a society? If the technology was perfect (say people made
regular backups) would a version of Ash who could only talk out of a
mobile phone be a completely different order than if the car accident
had just paralysed him? Isn’t it really another degree of the great
spectrum of disability? What I wonder is if this is the kind of attitude
that people in a few hundred years are going to find rather quaint -
will they be horrified at the&amp;nbsp;frailness&amp;nbsp;of all those people who went
through their lives without the wifi chip in their skull taking backups,
and a little amused that we thought their deathless society would be an
unnatural, wrong place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of death is one of the keystones of the transhumanist future and
different approaches abound everywhere in science fiction. In
Bear’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Eon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;universe, the inhabitants of Axis City get two chances in
a physical body before an indefinite existence in city memory. In
Clarke’s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;City and The Star&lt;/em&gt;s in order to make immortality viable
over millions of years without society growing stale (which fails, but
anyway) the people of Diaspar use a form of reincarnation, where people
are given twenty years or so to establish new lives before their
previous memories are returned to them. In Red Dwarf dead crew can be
bought back to life as holograms and the dead are a growing force in
society, when Rimmer is whining about being dead Lister just argues that
“death isn’t the handicap it used to be in the olden days.
It&amp;nbsp;doesn't&amp;nbsp;screw your career up the way it used to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a similar approach to the sanctity of death in fantasy where,
despite the otherwise strangeness of the world, often reversing ‘natural
death’ remains an uncrossable line. Magical worlds that co-exist with
the real world tend to certain rules to explain why the real world is
only superficially altered from our own with the addition of these
fantastic elements, usually in some form of unwritten Prime Directive of
non-interference - the specific problem being that magical rules tend to
be fair (in the sense that all actions can be reversed - at a cost)
whereas the real world is notably for being distinctly unfair. Harry
Potter's world has a host of magical ailments for magical healers to fix
but St Mungo’s doesn’t go around curing muggles of cancer. In Buffy,
Joyce and Tara are explicitly unable to be resurrected through magical
means because of the non-magical nature of the deaths and season five’s
&lt;em&gt;Forever&lt;/em&gt; dwells on the horrificness of trying to break this rule. While
the real- and other-world mix to some degree, real-world death is
repeatedly treated as a line the other just can't cross, or at least not
lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science fiction this comes up quite a lot in stories about time
travel - attempts to fix real-world wrongs using otherworldly
time-travel are frequently the source rather than remedy of regret.
As&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe&lt;/em&gt; puts it
&amp;quot;within a science fictional space, memory and regret are, when taken
together, the set of necessary and sufficient elements required to
produce a time machine&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the Whoverse this happens most explicitly
in &lt;em&gt;Father’s Day&lt;/em&gt; when Rose's attempt to save her father literally
breaks the story-world apart and lets monsters in from beyond the fourth
wall to teach her a lesson. The Tenth Doctor's “Time Lord Victorious”
speech in &lt;em&gt;Waters of Mars&lt;/em&gt; is effectively him declaring his refusal to
let his otherworldlyness bind his actions, hubris the story punishes him
for in short succession. However this is a line that Who is increasingly
fuzzy on, at the end of the &lt;em&gt;The Almost People&lt;/em&gt; the Doctor gives Cleaves
what is in effect a magic potion to fix the brain clot in her brain.
Like Joyce’s aneurysm in Buffy, the clot isn't caused by the Doctor or
the events of the story, it's presented as a decidedly human problem
that's solved (in a moment) through magical means. Similarly, in last
year’s Christmas episode a normal man was flying back in a doomed plane
from a normal war and is rescued from death through essentially magical
means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a story is showing the dark side of Trying To Change How Things
Were it tends to show history breaking in two ways. In Red Dwarf’s
&lt;em&gt;Tikka to Ride&lt;/em&gt; Kennedy’s assassination is accidentally prevented,
leading to an alternate history where Kennedy’s failings of a president
are given time to play out, leading to an earlier and different end to
the Cold War where the future the show is set in no longer exist, while
in Stephen King’s &lt;em&gt;11/22/63&lt;/em&gt; time&amp;nbsp;doesn't&amp;nbsp;want to be changed, and the
act of doing so on a large enough scale (preventing the Kennedy
assassination) breaks the universe, with earthquakes, disasters and a
decay of the laws of physics. One teaches the a lesson that history is
complicated and events have unexpected repercussions, the other that
meddling in the past is just Wrong with a capital W and you will be
punished for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their core Black Mirror and the range of similar stories&amp;nbsp;are
essentially conservative in the 'people aren't getting any better'
sense, but this also spills over into 'attempts to make people better
will always fail' - because the one thing we certainly can't be trusted
to change right is ourselves.&amp;nbsp;A future where people play pick 'n' mix
with their memories, change history on a whim, and the dead walk on the
streets demanding equal rights is certainly weird and unsettling to us
today - but wouldn’t they find stories demanding a ‘dead’ person go away
so everyone else can move on a little bit horrifying themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

everything I wrote on the blog last year (in vague theme groupings):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been posts about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/02/political-chickens/"&gt;the history of chicken suits in
politics&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;how&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/facebook-and-the-legible-person/"&gt;Facebook
is trying to make us more
legible&lt;/a&gt;.
I &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/progress-of-the-boundary-reviews/"&gt;went to a talk on the boundary
reviews&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and
in a piece of high-nerdery worked out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/electoral-reform-at-the-oscars/"&gt;the exact problem in the
electoral
system&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for
the Oscars.&amp;nbsp;There's also some number-crunching on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/how-political-is-eurovision-voting-really/"&gt;political&amp;nbsp;voting in
Eurovision&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/does-photoshopping-politicians-mislead-the-electorate/"&gt;weird and revealing complaint about a&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;ad in New
Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
an attempt to make sense of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/the-strange-maths-of-mandates/"&gt;weird world of political
mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up writing a fair amount on the Scottish&amp;nbsp;Independence&amp;nbsp;referendum
-&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/indyref-round-up/"&gt;I&amp;nbsp;summarised arguments made to the Scottish Affairs
Committee&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;explored&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/seats-for-powers/"&gt;the
history and problems of the 'seats for powers'
argument&lt;/a&gt;,
looked at the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/votes-at-16-in-scotland/"&gt;practical implications of votes at 16 in
Scotland&lt;/a&gt;
and thought that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/01/scottish-independence-and-the-electoral-register/"&gt;early&amp;nbsp;Westminster&amp;nbsp;arguments about electoral register
seemed
spurious&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;On
the release of section 30 order I noticed it &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/designated-campaigns-for-an-independence-referendum/"&gt;seemed to be giving
&amp;nbsp;powers to the Scottish Parliament it said it
wasn't&lt;/a&gt;,
something &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/update-on-designated-campaigns/"&gt;that seemed to be
confirmed&lt;/a&gt;
a few months later. &amp;nbsp;Still not sure where that one's going. (and from
2011 -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/"&gt;a post on multiple questions and ballot
design&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at democratic stuff, I wrote there's a good case to be made
for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/"&gt;allowing fractional voting below
18&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
that if it caused problems that's not terrible because&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/"&gt;democracy
should
be&amp;nbsp;disruptive&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;put
down some thoughts on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/pcc-elections-some-loose-thoughts-on-authorisation-in-elections/"&gt;exactly what we mean when we talk about
authorisation in
elections&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
pointed out&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;Gilad Sharon&amp;nbsp;seemed to be making &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/london-and-gaza-can-democratic-citizens-be-held-responsible-for-their-governments/"&gt;a very similar
argument about
democratic&amp;nbsp;accountability&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to
that made by the 7/7 bombers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the misc section, I looked at&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/slut-dropping-how-disgust-spreads-urban-legends/"&gt;&amp;nbsp;'slut dropping' in the context of
wider writing on urban
legends&lt;/a&gt;,
the limits of law to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/making-people-do-things/"&gt;make people do
things&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/11/mps-haircuts-and-debt/"&gt;barbers and debt
moralism&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and
examined&amp;nbsp;the Church of England's generous view of its history on gay
rights as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/06/same-sex-marriage-is-sexist-and-other-stories/"&gt;it argued that allowing same-sex marriage would be
sexist&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;When
in a&amp;nbsp;#slatepitches&amp;nbsp;mood, I argued we shouldn't limit ourselves
to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/cash-4-rights-why-stop-in-the-workplace/"&gt;selling off workplace
rights&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
asked what the problem really is with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/is-cash-for-honours-a-good-deal/"&gt;cash for
honours&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my pop-culture hat on, I looked at how sci-fi is working over
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/its-like-ive-landed-on-a-different-planet-the-imagery-of-911-in-sci-fi/"&gt;the&amp;nbsp;imagery&amp;nbsp;of

of the future in the Prometheus&amp;nbsp;promo
videos&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;how
the Walking Dead video game used the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/ethics-and-consequences-in-the-walking-dead-game/"&gt;pointlessness of choice to create
an
ethical&amp;nbsp;environment&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;I
saw&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/07/the-dark-knight-who-rises/"&gt;The Dark Knight

&lt;p&gt;In total that's 25,000 words on this blog last year, only 2000 less than
what I wrote doing my Masters course at the same time. I think I've
gotten better at this whole blogging thing over all those words, but
mileage may vary.&amp;nbsp;As ever,&amp;nbsp;apologies for people looking for the train
forum that used to be on the smokefilledroom domain who the stats say
make up a chunk of my visitors - I'll try and cater to you more this
year.&lt;/p&gt;

article&lt;/a&gt;
in the&amp;nbsp;Jerusalem&amp;nbsp;Post&amp;nbsp;has been rightly widely condemned as being a
pretty horrible thing for a mainstream newspaper to publish (even
bearing in mind the&amp;nbsp;Jerusalem&amp;nbsp;Post also published a &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/"&gt;he went too far,
but is he
wrong?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;article
after&amp;nbsp;Brievik), one part especially jumped out at me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
THE DESIRE to prevent harm to innocent civilians in Gaza will
ultimately lead to harming the truly innocent: the residents of
southern Israel. &lt;strong&gt;The residents of Gaza are not innocent, they
elected Hamas. The Gazans aren’t hostages; they chose this freely,
and must live with the consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember 7/7 bomber&amp;nbsp;Mohammad Sidique Khan's suicide tape, that
might be
a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm"&gt;familiar&amp;nbsp;sentiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Your &lt;strong&gt;democratically elected governments&lt;/strong&gt; continuously perpetuate
atrocities against my people all over the world.&amp;nbsp;And &lt;strong&gt;your support
of them makes you directly responsible&lt;/strong&gt;, just as I am directly
responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and
sisters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle here is simple: we elect our leaders, if our leaders chose
to wage war with our support then we are all legitimate targets, in or
out of uniform, on or off the battlefield. &amp;nbsp;It's not just to weaken the
material war effort or 'morale' of the enemy (dodgy, but anyway),
democratic civilians are morally culpable and so&amp;nbsp;indiscriminate&amp;nbsp;violence
can be justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens Sharon is just plain wrong on the facts, Hamas did win the
2006 elections but the current Hamas government in Gaza results from a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4"&gt;2007 takeover&lt;/a&gt;.
More interesting for this question is exactly why they won in 2006 - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jps.2006.35.3.20"&gt;a
combination of the electoral system and severe splits within
Fatah&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Post-election surveys showed the price of this disunity, a
distortion magnified&amp;nbsp;by an electoral system under which half the
seats were won in district races[at-large elections with multiple
seats] and the other half—the national list—were allocated according
to the list’s&amp;nbsp;proportion of the national vote. Thus, Hamas won 29
seats (against Fatah’s 28)&amp;nbsp;in the 66-seat national list with 44
percent of the vote. The non-Hamas vote&amp;nbsp;(56 percent)was divided
between Fatah and the four other PLO or “Third Way”&amp;nbsp;lists. But while
Hamas candidates won 45 (68 percent) of the 66 district seats&amp;nbsp;in
parliament, they did so with 36.5 of the vote. Sixty-three percent
voted for&amp;nbsp;non-Hamas candidates, the vast majority dispersed between
Fatah’s official and&amp;nbsp;independent candidates. In the end, Fatah won a
mere 17 seats in the districts.&amp;nbsp;On the basis of these figures it is
difficult to refute Awad’s conclusion. “Hamas&amp;nbsp;did not win the
elections—Fatah lost them.” (p.26)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 36.5% figure is interesting because Labour in the 2005 elections
won with just a percent less, on 35.2% percent of the vote. &amp;nbsp;In both
cases the 'culpable party' won with far less than majority support - can
we really say there's a lot of collective&amp;nbsp;responsibility&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait - those are the figures for the whole of Palestine - maybe the
Gaza districts were more Hamas hardcore. No such luck, using the break
down of results from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/Palestine2006-NDI-final.pdf"&gt;Carter Center
report&lt;/a&gt;
I made this table of how the vote played out (remember it's at-large
districts- as many votes as seats open - so there are many more votes
than voters):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even just within Gaza it's hard to argue Hamas had overwhelming
support.&amp;nbsp;It's also worth remembering that Gaza has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html"&gt;a pretty high
proportion of
children&lt;/a&gt;
(43.8% - 0-14) and so democratic decisions by the adult population
have&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/"&gt;more potential legitimacy
problems&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;than
might otherwise be the case. Saying children 'chose freely' to be bombed
because less than half of adults voted for a party six years ago might
be pushing democratic accountability a bit far.&lt;/p&gt;

interview&lt;/a&gt;
with Terry Pratchett&amp;nbsp;I decided to go back and finish this post I was
writing about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth"&gt;*The Long
Earth*&lt;/a&gt;, Pratchett's
recent collaboration with Stephen Baxter.&amp;nbsp;Obviously, spoilers spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic setting summary: In &lt;em&gt;The Long Earth&lt;/em&gt;, someone releases schematics
on the internet for an easy to build box with a switch. When the switch
is pressed, the user can travel either 'east' or 'west' through
infinite&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;Earths, with the near Earths being very similar to the
original 'datum' earth (but lacking in people) with weirder and wilder
creatures waiting in the far off Earths.&amp;nbsp;One of the fun things about
reading collaborations between well-known authors is trying to break
down who introduced what elements.&amp;nbsp;Sometimes you can pick up the voices,
but in cases like the Long Earth tracking the lineage of the ideas
involved is illuminating.&amp;nbsp;While based on an old idea of Pratchett's, the
threads of it have appeared in a few previous Baxter books (which is
probably why the project is such a good fit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Baxter's &lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt;, the world is changed by the&amp;nbsp;appearance&amp;nbsp;of the Red
Moon (which replaces the boring grey one). The Red Moon travels
from&amp;nbsp;parallel&amp;nbsp;earth to parallel earth, opening up portals and picking up
and depositing creatures from world to world. Through this, it picked up
humanity's&amp;nbsp;predecessors at various points in history and deposited them
on other earths, where they evolve in different and similar ways,
aquatic apes, puritans with tails, super-intelligent&amp;nbsp;gorillas who hug
the surface of their gigantic and windswept Earth. So the idea that
there are places beside our own where humanity's cousins (in &lt;em&gt;The Long
Earth&lt;/em&gt;'s case Trolls and Elves) developed in their own strange ways is
a&amp;nbsp;familiar&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Trolls are largely peaceful creatures who make people feel better
by singing while Elves are intelligent, malicious hunters where some
species farm others for their brains fits into the Pratchett&amp;nbsp;rebellion
against Tolkien regarding elves (from &lt;em&gt;Lords and Ladies)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are terrific. They beget terror.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a
snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words
that have changed their meaning.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;No one ever said elves are nice.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Elves are bad.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Long Earth&lt;/em&gt; is also an example of, &amp;nbsp;for lack of a better term,
&amp;quot;Democratic Science Fiction&amp;quot; - where an extraordinary change is put in
the hands of every person.&amp;nbsp;What's a world like where everyone has
superpowers?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When anyone can travel in time? When anyone can get a
potato and a switch, and step into another earth? This is ground Baxter
has visited before in a previous&amp;nbsp;collaboration with Arthur C. Clark in
&lt;em&gt;The Light Of Other Days&lt;/em&gt;, where the invention of wormhole technology
allows anyone to view any location, anywhere in history - effectively
abolishing privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobsang is an interesting element, a sentient computer that claims to be
the reincarnated soul of a&amp;nbsp;Tibetan&amp;nbsp;car mechanic.&amp;nbsp;Someone obscure
being&amp;nbsp;reincarnated&amp;nbsp;as a computer feels like a classic Pratchett&amp;nbsp;footnote
joke (and there has been a 'Lobsang' in the Discworld-verse) , but it's
tempered and kept in line with a sci-fi universe by the heavy hinting
that Lobsang is just pretending to be reincarnated&amp;nbsp;to have a better
claim to have personhood rights. To make an end of paragraph habit,
Baxter's collaboration with Clarke in the &lt;em&gt;Time Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;series also
featured AI's with recognised rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might guess from how often I've referred back to his previous books
that this story 'feels' more like Baxter than Pratchett but
his&amp;nbsp;sensibilities&amp;nbsp;are clearly there if you look. I wouldn't say it's
either of their greatest works, but it's a perfectly enjoyable read that
plays with its world in a way that I'm not sure would have come
naturally to either of them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

viral story on Facebook, &amp;nbsp;I was reading&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years"&gt;David Graeber's
Debt&lt;/a&gt; at the
same time and it&amp;nbsp;occurred&amp;nbsp;to me what a wonderful summation this story is
of a certain kind of debt morality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. After the cut, he
asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money
from you; I'm doing community service this week.' The florist was
pleased and left the shop. When the barber went to open his shop the
next morning, there was a 'thank you' card and a dozen roses waiting
for him at his door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his
bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you; I'm
doing community service this week.' The cop was happy and left the
shop. The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a
'thank you' card and a dozen doughnuts waiting for him at his door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then an MP came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill,
the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing
community service this week.' The MP was very happy and left the
shop. The next morning, when the barber went to open up, there were
a dozen MPs lined up waiting for a free haircut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between
the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have the evil MPs (it's an anglicised&amp;nbsp;US story, other versions
on the internet use 'politicians') are happy to take the humble barber
for all they can, while the upstanding members of the community show
their gratitude with gifts, and are thus good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, wasn't the barber trying to perform community service? Didn't
he say he didn't want money? Why is it good to sneakily leave gifts of,
in the florist's case, at least equivalent&amp;nbsp;monetary value when he can't
refuse? The barber tried to give to the community but the cop and the
florist go against his wishes and try to pay him, because of the
discomfort of the cop and florist to even the perception of being in
another's debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graeber comes into this because he argues that the role of barter is to
manage goods between strangers but in long-standing communities credit
arrangements dominate. Something that caught my eye was that in some
societies, to try to clear all debts would be an absurdity because to
try would be to decide not to be a member of the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, it's the florist and cop who are determined to
treat the barber as a stranger by not allowing a debt to stand
uncompensated,&amp;nbsp;whereas the MP spreads word of someone who wants to give
and gives them the opportunity to give more. Who's really the bad guy in
this scenario?&amp;nbsp;I find it interesting how revealing a story clearly meant
to represent 'common sense' is about a particular modern idea of debt
and community.&lt;/p&gt;

low&lt;/a&gt; and this is raising some
questions about the legitimacy of elections with low turnouts. &amp;nbsp;What
does it mean for an election if almost no-one takes part?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that elections are claimed to do is 'authorise', but there
tends to be fuzziness on exactly what that means. The general problem
when defining what 'authorising' means in an election is that having a
definition creates the possibility of elections that fail to meet that
definition. &amp;nbsp;One possible escape from this is to use the argument that
'authorising' collapses quickly into tacit consent, where a&amp;nbsp;typical
series of moves might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming majority rule is valid, if more than half of a population
agree to authorize the same person, then the election has authorized
that person.&amp;nbsp;But wait, many elections are won by people without
majorities - how can they be authorised?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, let's say that by taking part in an election, they decide to
accept the end of the process is authorised. Collectively over 50%
agree to this, the 40% winner is authorised. But wait,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;some
elections have less than 50% turnout! How can that count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, by opting to live in a democratic society people agree to
abide by certain rules, which includes accepting the winner of
elections as authorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each stage makes the claim to authorisation more flimsy (I think it's
still valid as far as the second stage) and the trouble is this
quick&amp;nbsp;collapses into tacit consent makes all discussion of authorisation
in elections pretty much meaningless. If&amp;nbsp;absolutely every election can
be said to authorize the winner, it really has no meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way out of this hole where we obviously have some elections that no
reasonable standard could call authorising is that not all elections
need to involve authorisation: elections can either be authorizing or
consultative. &amp;nbsp;Authorising elections perform the function of the people
empowering a person/chamber to act and take decisions on their behalf,
whereas consultative elections are essentially very official polls. &amp;nbsp;The
logic in the case of PCC elections would be roughly the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elections can either be exercises in authorization or
consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all elections achieve 50% (notably local elections and
referenda).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An authorised chamber has the power to delegate its authority on
certain matters to sub-chambers staffed by whatever process it
chooses, including consultative elections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chamber elected with less than 50% turnout can legitimately
take decisions if its authority is established by a superior
chamber with sufficient authorisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same logic allows referenda with less than 50% turnout to be
acted on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this logic, PCC elections are fine no matter how low the turnout,
as they're a consultative election - if they were appointed or picked
out of a hat, they would be equally authorised. &amp;nbsp;The question is then if
elections with low turnout are a good or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/pcc-elections-what-price-democracy"&gt;cost
effective&lt;/a&gt;
method of picking the right people for the job, which an interesting and
important question - but one detached from legitimacy and authorisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This passes a low bar for a definition of authorisation in that there
are some possible elections that would not be authorised, elections to
the superior chamber need to have at least 50% turnout (and as such
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Central_by-election,_2012"&gt;Manchester Central
by-election&lt;/a&gt;
result would&amp;nbsp;definitely&amp;nbsp;fall short).&amp;nbsp;There is a final dodge&amp;nbsp;available&amp;nbsp;to
MPs in the&amp;nbsp;British&amp;nbsp;system - that their elections can be seen as
consultative as &amp;nbsp;their power comes from the crown - &amp;nbsp;but this is a bit
of a unique case and is growingly out of step with the expanded role of
the&amp;nbsp;British&amp;nbsp;electorate in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach isn't just saying that one set of elections needs 50% - in
federal arrangements where different powers are sent to different
places, multiple bodies would need to be elected by authorising
elections. Likewise there'd be a strong case for requiring 50% turnout
on constitutionally required referendums. If elections have an
authorising role then turnout has to, at least sometimes, be practically
significant. How this would actually be managed practically (delay
November by-elections till May?) is a different question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/"&gt;Telltale&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Lw312RrXk"&gt;Sam &amp;amp;
Max&lt;/a&gt; games and in recent
games started to notice a trend towards games that had some
consideration of ethical issues. In their &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; game
characters have a lengthy debate about the morality of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency"&gt;lysine
contingency&lt;/a&gt;,
and in their &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; game a version of Emmett Brown
pointedly asks what gives you (Marty) the right to use time travel to
decide which people should and shouldn't be living happy lives in 1985.
While I ended up being disappointed by the game&amp;nbsp;ending in both cases, I
was impressed at how Telltale had found ways to mine&amp;nbsp;the world of
the&amp;nbsp;franchises they're playing in&amp;nbsp;and ask interesting ethical questions
about them. While the show version of &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; has issues, I
was interested to see what Telltale would do with a world that was
essentially always about making difficult ethical choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; game exists in roughly the same world as the comics
and TV show&amp;nbsp;(not aware if it's considered in the same canon as either,
although there is some character overlap) where the world is overrun by
a zombie&amp;nbsp;apocalypse and the driving narrative force is dealing with&amp;nbsp;how
people exist with uncomfortable decisions and the end of
civilisation.&amp;nbsp;Gameplay is relatively simple, the majority of the game is
spent going between cut-scenes and dialogue options, where&amp;nbsp;your choices
of dialogue will affect your relationship with other characters,
affecting future dialogue.&amp;nbsp;There are also scenes where there is freedom
to roam and accomplish traditional point-and-click game tasks, or&amp;nbsp;action
sequences with Quick Time events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of each episode the game tells you: '&lt;em&gt;This game series
adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.'&lt;/em&gt;
However what becomes apparent quite quickly is that your ability to make
choices that drastically affect the story is quite limited but what I
found especially interesting after playing the first few episodes was
how this made the game better at being an 'ethics game' than an
endlessly branching story might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take a typical choice, there's a situation where you can choose to
act morally, but this will cause you to have less time to gather
supplies. However aside from some dialogue about this the supplies
themselves mean nothing, this isn't a game with health bars and you are
physically able to carry out the same tasks no matter how much your
character has eaten.&amp;nbsp;Similarly a decision whether or not to take
supplies from a possible abandoned car doesn't matter, your group will
survive and be alive and well in the next episode anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To an extent this is making lives easier for the developers who don't
have to track and script every possible divergent fork.&amp;nbsp;Unlike some text
adventure games it won't severely punish you hours down the line from a
decision made early on (and most decisions that cause divergent paths
collapse to the same outcome, if through slightly different means), all
death events are caused by&amp;nbsp;insufficient&amp;nbsp;button mashing and there are
very few places where you can through dialogue choices lead to a 'game
over'. However, practical&amp;nbsp;considerations&amp;nbsp;aren't the only ones here and I
think the general inflexibility of the game world goes&amp;nbsp;some way&amp;nbsp;towards
making this an interestingly ethics-based game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to work out how to account for ethical choices in a game like
this I was reminded of a season two episode of &lt;em&gt;Angel&lt;/em&gt; -
'&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(Angel)"&gt;Epiphany&lt;/a&gt;'. In
this episode&amp;nbsp;Angel, who had seen himself as a pivotal player in the
battle between good and evil, realises what a small player he really is
and decides that if the big ends are unchangeable then how he chooses to
act is the only thing that matters -&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;If nothing we do matters, then all
that matters is what we do&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a credo that carries over well to The Walking Dead.&amp;nbsp;Your
character simply does not have the power to influence the world around
him to huge degrees. We, as players, know that the world is on rails and
certain events are inevitable regardless of our choices but the
reactions of other characters are flexible enough to our choices that
there is a sense of immersion and weight to choices we make. &amp;nbsp;The key
question here is if your character is powerless to prevent or control
his fate, does it make choosing to behave ethically more or less
meaningful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that this lack of control takes away a lot of traditional
gaming thinking from the player. If it was possible to prevent every
death, there'd be incentive for people to see each death as a failure
and constantly reload in search of that '100% complete' achievement (à
la&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Heavy Rain&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;nbsp;By keeping choices about choosing sides (and
aligning yourself with various other characters), the game sidesteps the
problem of creating right and wrong answers to puzzles - there are
simply choices you make. And if these choices have no effect on 'game
score' - then there is no disincentive to role play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you decide which four out of ten people will get food?&amp;nbsp;You can
play it by who you want to keep 'on side' but as established that
doesn't matter-matter &amp;nbsp;- by taking away practical gaming considerations
the game makes you consider what you would do in those circumstances.
&amp;nbsp;When the game offered me a choice of keeping the last piece of food for
myself, I&amp;nbsp;was stuck on that decision for a minute or so - without
in-game&amp;nbsp;consequences&amp;nbsp;our own sense of ethics can be fully engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the flip side is the question of can a game that doesn't make
you suffer for picking morally better
but&amp;nbsp;practically&amp;nbsp;disadvantageous&amp;nbsp;decisions really be asking you to make
meaningful decisions?&amp;nbsp;To which I'd answer that meaningful in the game
and meaningful to the player are quite different things.&amp;nbsp;By turning off
gamer logic, the game changes the basis you make decisions on. You're
not choosing which version of the game you want to be playing an hour
down the line but are forced to make decisions based on personal
considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; may in some senses be far more linear than
it's described as, the linear plot creates room for an interesting kind
of sandbox ethics game. Even if most choices don't matter to the story,
they do matter to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interesting but unrelated:

order&lt;/a&gt;
to empower the Scottish Parliament to pass&amp;nbsp;legislation&amp;nbsp;on
an&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;referendum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[4 (2)] In those provisions as applied by this article, references,
however expressed, to a person or body designated under section 108
[of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]&amp;nbsp;are to be
read as references to a person or body designated under an Act of
the Scottish Parliament for the purposes of an independence
referendum as representing those campaigning for a particular
outcome in relation to the question in the referendum.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in interesting because &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108"&gt;section
108&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;gives
the power to appoint&amp;nbsp;designated&amp;nbsp;campaigns (who gain
certain&amp;nbsp;financial&amp;nbsp;assistance, access to broadcast and freepost) to the
Electoral Commission - instead this is indicating the Scottish
Parliament will have the ability to directly&amp;nbsp;designate&amp;nbsp;campaigns for the
respective sides.&amp;nbsp;As there's yet to be a case where there was serious
competition between two groups for the same designated status this seem
relatively&amp;nbsp;harmless, although technically this would also allow one
campaign to be&amp;nbsp;designated&amp;nbsp;without the other (seems unlikely).&amp;nbsp;The
Scottish Parliament could of course pass this back to the Electoral
Commission when they come to legislate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&amp;nbsp;The memorandum of agreement seems to be stating that the
Electoral Commission should retain its role of 'designating lead
campaign organisations' which makes the above curious. I suspect in the
grand scheme of things it's doing absolutely nothing, but I'm just not
sure why it's there at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.1 (a) in the s 30 order directly refers to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/127"&gt;s 127 of
PPERA&lt;/a&gt;,
which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A broadcaster shall not include in its broadcasting services any
referendum campaign broadcast made on behalf of any person or body
other than one designated in respect of the referendum in question
&lt;strong&gt;under section 108&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;And I'm wondering if 4.2 is then just being over&amp;nbsp;cautious&amp;nbsp;in relation
to this. If the Electoral Commission retains its designation powers,
those groups will be designated by s 108 and be counted under that
anyway. If that's the explanation, then 4.2 isn't needed at all and is
actually transferring more than they intended to the Scottish

election broadcasts and mailshots (not a hugely useful power but hey).&lt;/p&gt;

said&lt;/a&gt;
to&amp;nbsp;a gathering of donors at the Conservative Party conference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Look, I have no problem giving honours to donors,”&amp;nbsp;David
Cameron&amp;nbsp;declared. “They are doing a public service, in my view.
Otherwise, we’d have to turn to state funding of our political
parties, which would just add to our deficit and be totally
unacceptable.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, I find myself agreeing with him.&amp;nbsp;Parties are
essential to the democratic system ticking over, parties need money to
run, parties need to get money from somewhere. I think there's an
excellent case for state funding of parties but if in the meantime we
have cash in one set of hands and in the other set of hands we have
honours that people like (but don't really mean that much) that seems a
fair deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the little snag here: selling honours is a criminal offence
under the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/72/section/1"&gt;Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act
1925&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
you have to wonder if the&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;giving me money is a public good and people
should be rewarded for contributing to the public good&amp;quot; line is really
enough not to fall foul of this. The offence was&amp;nbsp;introduced after Lloyd
George was quite brazenly selling off&amp;nbsp;honours&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://everything2.com/user/aneurin/writeups/Lloyd+George+and+the+Honours+Scandal"&gt;for party
funding&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(his&amp;nbsp;scheme&amp;nbsp;went
so far as to have&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;a published tariff with a knighthood being available
for £10,000, a baronetcy for £30,000, with a peerage title costing
upwards of £50,000&amp;quot;). The big trouble is peerages as these bestow some
actual power with a seat in House of Lords - but assuming the Lords was
abolished for a minute, what's the objection? There is the perception of
corruption when rich people give things to parties and get nice things
in return, but does a knighthood really have much utility beyond feeling
quite nice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A party system funding&amp;nbsp;solely&amp;nbsp;by the rich gives the wrong incentives but
we could refine this to give everyone an incentive to get involved:&amp;nbsp;why
not open it up and officialise&amp;nbsp;Cash for Honours by making the process a
lottery? People have given money into the various party pots - pick a
few pounds out and bestow a few honours that way. If you operate a few
different pots for different donation ranges, a&amp;nbsp;fair amount will end up
with the same set of wealthy donors, but it will also introduce a chance
that everyday party supporters could be rewarded for the noble work of
ensuring our&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;system's wheels stay&amp;nbsp;greased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm being a little&amp;nbsp;facetious here and this process would raise all kinds
of questions (a knighthood for donating to the BNP?) but I think the
core question is a good one: why is the idea of the&amp;nbsp;government&amp;nbsp;using its
ability to bestow honours to fund these vital democratic functions
inherently bad?&lt;/p&gt;

didn't touch on last time &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/"&gt;I wrote about votes for
children&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;that children's different experiences alone, regardless of any question
of&amp;nbsp;competence&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;sufficient&amp;nbsp;to justify&amp;nbsp;representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often annoys me about Votes at 16 arguments is that so many of the
arguments deployed are incredibly regressive.&amp;nbsp;Children can pay tax, they
should vote! And we'll take away the vote from adults who don't? &amp;nbsp;If we
lived in democracies with property requirements child voting advocates
would be arguing that 16-year-olds can own property and should vote, not
that there's something wrong with the basic idea.&amp;nbsp;Fundamentally there's
no difference between this tax position and&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100010127/a-tax-based-alternative-to-the-alternative-vote/"&gt;Ian Cowie's
idea&lt;/a&gt;
that only those who paid more than £100 income tax should be allowed to
vote, which itself isn't a long way removed from an argument that the
rich pay for more more of the state, why shouldn't they have more of a
say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British democracy has its origins in exactly this idea of a stakeholder
democracy, expanding to include any group that might threaten it from
the outside. But the real merit of democracy is that it is so disruptive
of existing norms - democracy shouldn't simply reflect other power
structures (the rich having more of a say than others, men wielding more
decision making power than women) but should work to undermine those
structures by expressing the always radical notion that
everyone&amp;nbsp;deserves&amp;nbsp;an equal say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children represent a distinct interest, a massive consumer of state
services (which occupy and direct a large amount of their time) and yet
the argument often deployed is that they are so like us that it would
unfair not to include them, not that they are so different we are
missing a vital voice. As &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chd.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/09/06/0907568211406756"&gt;Wall put
it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[C]hildren may not always have as much autonomy or power as adults,
but they are every bit as different. If the purpose of democratic
representation is to respond to the fullest possible diversity of
social experiences, then it includes responding to children – and to
children’s endless diversity – just as much as it does to adults.
Indeed, children would take on a heightened status as the most
important test of being democratic, since they are more likely than
most to call for political responsiveness from the whole. &lt;strong&gt;Being
represented in the political sphere should not depend entirely on
how competently one can argue for one’s interests or how effectively
one can struggle against others for power. It should depend finally
on how different one’s experiences are from those of others.&lt;/strong&gt; (p.
10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to vote should be as expansive as possible because those
voted into office are given power over the lives of all. It should
be presumed that everyone can vote unless a compelling argument can
be provided for exclusion. Children’s right to vote is important if
elected representatives are to perform their democratic duties of
challenging historical marginalization and responding to
constituents’ fullest differences. (p. 12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective because the notion of letting children vote is
unsettling is an excellent reason to do it - it will disrupt current
power relations in a way that improve society. &amp;nbsp;There's a fine argument
that actually, children are a different class of excluded person than
all previous examples because their immaturity is transitional - one day
they will grow up, no one is&amp;nbsp;permanently&amp;nbsp;excluded - but for the
'democracy as difference' argument this is hollow comfort because their
'difference' representing the child's interests is lost.&amp;nbsp;If the blanket
inclusion this implies is too radical, there are schemes &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/"&gt;that represent
children on a fractional
basis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(which
are at least no worse than complete exclusion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My&amp;nbsp;personal opinion on votes at 16 has always tended towards supportive
indifference, however currently&amp;nbsp;I'm trying to write something long on
political equality and democracy and it's been eye opening to see how
many democratic theorists are just as willing to ignore the issue
('assume a population of adults' is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow"&gt;spherical
cow&lt;/a&gt; of democratic
theory). It's becoming increasingly hard to hold to the stance that this
is an unimportant issue, in the UK the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx"&gt;proportion of the population
under
fifteen&lt;/a&gt;
is 18% - in Iraq and Libya it's 43%, Tanzania 45%, Uganda 48%.&amp;nbsp;In places
where the proportion of children to adults almost approaches parity,&amp;nbsp;how
can any account of democracy that excludes children not be severely
flawed?&lt;/p&gt;

extended in&amp;nbsp;Scotland&amp;nbsp;for the independence referendum &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19900973"&gt;to include sixteen
and seventeen
year-olds&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;I've
written before on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/03/votes-at-16-and-younger/"&gt;Votes at 16
argument&lt;/a&gt;
(shorter version: most argument for it are&amp;nbsp;unsatisfying, interesting
approach might be&amp;nbsp;graduated&amp;nbsp;and fractional voting rights far below
16)&amp;nbsp;but while I'm posting abandoned avenues from my dissertation I
thought it was worth including the section I wrote on the idea of
expanding the&amp;nbsp;franchise&amp;nbsp;for referendums, before giving up on that side
of the project because it seemed a bit unlikely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possible consideration for referendums not mentioned in the
Electoral Commission report is if it’s intended for the referendum
electorate to be different (larger or smaller) from that of the
normal electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, expanding the franchise to include
those 16 and 17 year-olds is something under active consideration
(but probably doubtful) for the Scottish independence referendum and
a former civil servant indicated at the Constitution Unit talk on
Scottish Independence that similar measures were considered (but
ultimately rejected) in terms of expanding the electorate were made
for the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum (in that case to
holidaymakers and those abroad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked by the Scottish Affairs
Committee on how long the process of preparing for an expanded
electorate would take Andrew Scallan (Director of Electoral
Administration at The Electoral Commission) spent a long time not
wanting to give a precise answer as to how long the process of
expanding the registers would take (more than a week, less than a
year) but did suggest the best scenario would be legislation in the
summer followed by a household canvas in the Autumn and at other
times of year the process might be more difficult/result in a less
complete register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of otherwise unexplored issues of
referendum time, this could be interesting but involves quite an
expansion of scope into discussion of electoral registers
(especially in terms of the pending switchover to individual
electoral registration) for what is likely to remain a hypothetical
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So opps on that, but practical considerations still interesting. This
might also affect future UK referendums because it diminishes the
precedent of referendums only using existing electorates - so in future
referendums we could have similar moves to try and include other un-able
to vote groups.&amp;nbsp;Should non-EU citizens vote in a UK referendum on
leaving the EU? &amp;nbsp;Strangely that might not even be a&amp;nbsp;hypothetical, as EU
citizens are part of the Holyrood electorate they should be able to vote
in this one - and whether the new Scotland would automatically be an EU
member &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9303587/European-Commission-Separate-Scotland-forced-to-reapply-for-EU-membership.html"&gt;is still up for
debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also&amp;nbsp;something I hadn't picked up on before is that this isn't the only
movement on the subject in Scotland, since last year the crofting
elections franchise&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2011/456/regulation/4/made"&gt;extends to 16 year
olds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

with me a minute. While researching for my Masters dissertation I spent
some time looking at how various&amp;nbsp;countries&amp;nbsp;deal with accuracy
requirements in&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;advertising - I might convert some of my
conclusions into blog form at some point but in the meantime I'll share
a complaint I found quite funny. In New Zealand rules about accuracy in
broadcast and print apply to&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;advertising (although this is a
rare event) and looking through the 2008 cases I found a wonderful
complaint to their Advertising Standards Agency by a man who claimed
that then PM Helen Clark was misleading the electorate by using a
photoshopped image of herself on posters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer in this instance is the voting public. &amp;nbsp;Clearly what is
represented as the image of Helen Clark is intended to appeal to a
younger less knowledgeable voter. &amp;nbsp;The Labour Party have used this
exaggerated image of a youthful vibrant younger woman as the face of
the Party to mislead the voting decisions of a less knowledgeable
group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual image in the Billboard is clearly intended to mislead,
and the standard has been set by your sister organisation – the BSA
in its ruling against TV3[*]. &amp;nbsp;They had nothing to gain from using
an actor to voice over an interview, the Labour Party have
everything to gain from misleading the voting public – even if only
by a few votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASA rejected this, arguing that &amp;quot;it was common practice in a
wide-range of sectors for people to take additional care with their
appearance when their image was used for publicity purposes&amp;quot; - what
makes this extra wonderful is that the&amp;nbsp;complainant&amp;nbsp;appealed this
decision, arguing that using photoshopped images was so deceitful it
brought the integrity of the whole party into question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Labour Party has framed Election 08 around the issue of Trust.
This is probably the most important election we as a nation has
faced for many years. As such every vote cast is important and the
voting public need to be protected from the misleading visual image
projected in the billboards (and other media).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commercial trader potently can make financial gain by presenting
goods or services with professionally enhanced images. By way of
example if a used car dealer advertised an image of a vehicle that
looked pristine, then when it was inspected it was found to have
rust, mismatched paint, and no mag wheels, then the dealer is in
breach of the guidelines and consumer laws. Your august body acting
on the initiative of a complaint from the public would review the
standards and apply a ruling to remove the offending advertisement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, as a concerned citizen I feel compelled to act and voice
my opinion that the political party trying to project &amp;quot;Trust&amp;quot; as the
major focus of this election is able to knowing promote itself with
a visual presentation that is clearly and intentionally designed to
mislead a segment of the voting public and gain the favour of those
less knowledgeable. As such the billboards in question breach the
standard set out in Rule 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not just another advertisement by a dodgy car dealer or a
dramatization from an enthusiastic broadcaster - it is vital that
this appeal is considered carefully as it has serious and far
reaching implications for the future of New Zealand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which didn't find much favour with the appeal board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acting Chairperson said that the identity of the Advertiser in
this Advertisement was clear, both through the authorisation
statement, the use of the identifiable party colours and name, and
through the image of the leader of the party. Regarding the question
of fact and opinion, the Acting Chairperson agreed that this element
of Rule 11 was not raised by this Advertisement. Accordingly she
ruled the Advertisement met the requirements of Rule 11 was not in
breach of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Acting Chairperson took into account the Complainant’s concerns,
however, she was of the view, that &lt;strong&gt;as the Prime Minister and
leader of Labour Party, the public profile of the Rt Hon Helen
Clark, across a wide range of media, was such that the general
public would be familiar with her appearance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there's a fair case to be made that this complaint has a degree
of sexism and well as ageism to it, I find it hard (not impossible) to
imagine the same 'people wouldn't vote her if they knew she was ooolldd'
being levelled against a male&amp;nbsp;politician? Comparing a politician's&amp;nbsp;image
to a rusty car seems an especially thin point - when you buy a car, you
buy the car, when you vote a politicians you're not 'buying' their body.
Years later,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=10824495"&gt;someone made a similar complaint to the UN ethics
office&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about
a picture of her on a UN website and there's a definite&amp;nbsp;ugliness&amp;nbsp;about
this kind of complaint.&amp;nbsp;We laugh about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/david-cameron-campaign-poster-rumour"&gt;Cameron
poster&lt;/a&gt;,
but don't say it calls into question his fundamental character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, isn't it quite nice that even
this&amp;nbsp;frivolous&amp;nbsp;complaint was taken seriously and given (and as
the&amp;nbsp;complainant&amp;nbsp;says, prompt) consideration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* This relates to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/2752"&gt;a
decision&lt;/a&gt; by the NZ BSA
that a broadcast that declared&amp;nbsp;an interview used an actor's voice, but
didn't declare the silhouetted&amp;nbsp;figure was itself an actor was in breach
of accuracy rules.&lt;/p&gt;

Project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;column introduced the
internet to what is highly likely to be a new urban legend: Slut
dropping. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html"&gt;The full story
goes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He described a group of excited male first-years who told him about
a new trend: “slut dropping”. The process, they explained, involves
driving around town with friends in the early hours of the morning
and offering a lift home to a young woman they deem a “slut”
(usually a woman in a “post-club state”). After asking her address,
they drive as fast and as far as possible in the opposite direction
before forcing the woman out of the car and using a camera to film
her “standing by the side of the road as they drive away”.&amp;nbsp; Some of
the images find their way onto the internet, part of a disturbing
new trend of ‘slut-shaming’. On one occasion, the first-year added,
it had taken the girl eight hours to get home. When asked how he
knew, he explained that they were ‘friends’ on Facebook.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious reasons to be suspicious of this: it's incredibly
elaborate and our source is 'people who our source talked to who heard
it off someone on facebook'. All urban legends seem to happen at that
friend of friend remove, both&amp;nbsp;immediate&amp;nbsp;and distant. Another interesting
aspect is &amp;nbsp;'offering a lift home' because the story now involves the
woman making a choice. Urban legends are the oldest form of education -
telling you what choices and decisions are good or bad. This&amp;nbsp;is why
urban legends are often structured exactly like horror stories, with
shared origins in scary stories told to teach the young lessons. &amp;nbsp;It's
not enough that horrible things happen to you, you have to have made
choices that lead to this - as Cabin in the Woods put it&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;if they don’t
transgress, they can’t be punished”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brunvard argues that urban legends &amp;quot;often&amp;nbsp;depict&amp;nbsp;a clash between modern
conditions and some aspect of a traditional life-style&amp;quot;[1. Brunvard, Jan
Harold (1981), The Vanishing Hitchhiker, New York: Norton, p. 18&amp;nbsp;] and
here the conflict is with the idea of the modern, sexually liberated
woman. In this case the woman has committed three sins, looking like a
&amp;quot;slut&amp;quot;, walking home alone in the early hours and accepting a lift in a
stranger's car.&amp;nbsp;That an urban legend obeys the rule of three isn't a
huge surprise - it's a storytelling rule for a reason, and urban legends
like all good memes will mutate till they find their most
attractive-to-spread form. We're invited to feel disgust that there are
people out there who would do this, which&amp;nbsp;fascinatingly&amp;nbsp;is the emotion
the most successful urban legends will pull on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Heath_Emotional_Selection.pdf"&gt;Heath, Bell and
Sternberg
argue&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(p
32)&amp;nbsp;that urban legends aren't just selected on&amp;nbsp;informational &amp;nbsp;content,
but emotional content and will mutate to their most disgusting form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In general, the studies provide converging evidence for emotional
selection. Study 1 showed that, controlling for informational
aspects of truth and usefulness, people were more willing to pass
along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 manipulated
levels of disgust, and showed that people preferred to pass along
the versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3
showed that legends could be reliably coded for individual story
motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated
substance). It also showed that the number of motifs affected
popularity; legends that contained more disgust motifs were more
likely to be passed along and were distributed more widely on web
sites that specialize in contemporary legends. The results of Study
3 are particularly interesting because they suggest that emotional
selection may alter the distribution of memes in the social
environment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clues as to what earlier versions of this legend may have
looked like: they don't just drop women off in the middle of nowhere -
they take pictures, they put it on&amp;nbsp;Facebook! And what happens next? The
story spreads - look at the words used to describe 'slut dropping' in
follow-ups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;'Slut Dropping' Becomes Disturbing Trend In England&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jezebel.com/5950287/slut+dropping-and-other-ways-college-teaches-kids-to-be-sexist-assholes"&gt;Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, let me introduce you to a practice known as &amp;quot;slut-dropping.&amp;quot;
Apparently it's all the rage in the UK, and I'm shocked that it
hasn't caught on Stateside, since this sounds right up a lot of
jerks' alleys.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the meme has mutated again - it's not just a single
horrible&amp;nbsp;incident, it's a trend, it has a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;, it's happening
everywhere! We're no longer at the mercy of a depraved few, but exist in
a depraved society where this happens all the time. I don't know about
you, but that sounds pretty disgusting and spreadable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this post I've been pretty dismissive of the idea that this
is a real thing because it has so many traits of an urban legend that
it'd be a surprise if it wasn't - there is of course
the&amp;nbsp;possibility&amp;nbsp;that this happened somewhere at least once and mutated
into the legend it has now become. However as described 'slut dropping'
pretty much amounts to abduction and police records in the area in
question (where is that again?) could be a help for those looking to
confirm the story (though of course lack of records doesn't necessarily
disprove it) - it'll be interesting to see if anyone comes up with
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As urban legends are always mutating to get around your defences and

contracts that exchange '&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9593955/George-Osborne-workers-of-the-world-unite...and-give-up-your-employment-rights.html"&gt;workplace rights for tax-free shares in the
company&lt;/a&gt;'.
While on the surface, this is trading hard-won employment rights for
magic beans that may or may not be worth much (and in many businesses'
cases, a wily employer could make it &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/10/the-fundamental-problem-with-osbornes-employee-ownership-plan"&gt;worth very little
indeed&lt;/a&gt;)
that's no reason to be harsh on the principle which could be used for
any number of things - what are other rights worth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a look through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art15"&gt;European Convention on Human
Rights&lt;/a&gt; and ask
yourself, am I really ever going to use that?&amp;nbsp;Take the prohibition in
Article 2 against the death penalty, even when we had it in the 20th
century we only executed around &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats"&gt;11 people a
year&lt;/a&gt;. Using
the 1900 population stats (which only increase and so make this even
more favourable) and assuming a life span of 80, I only have a&amp;nbsp;0.002%
chance* of being&amp;nbsp;executed in my lifetime &amp;nbsp;- &amp;nbsp;might I not be happy to
take few quid a year to waive&amp;nbsp;my right not be executed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, no one is going to offer me money to waive that right&amp;nbsp;for
exactly the same reason it might be appealing, &amp;nbsp;it's not worth much to
me because the chances of execution are low and it's not worth much to
other people because the number of people wanting to execute me is also
low (hopefully). &amp;nbsp;In the case for employment rights for shares, the
reasoning is that&amp;nbsp;these are rights that people are quite likely to
exercise, but actually things would be better if they didn't.&amp;nbsp;The ideal
situation for everyone is one where the right is worth very little to me
but quite a lot to someone else and there's an obvious candidate for
this - voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a famous problem for rational choice explanations of voting
behaviour&amp;nbsp;that the benefit to the individual of voting is tiny compared
even to the very cheap costs of voting as the chances that your vote is
the one that changes the outcome is so tiny that taking it seriously is
like planning a route to work that avoids lottery-funded asteroid
strikes**. For those of us voting in safe seats we can be pretty
confident that our vote is almost entirely useless. &amp;nbsp;The fact that
turnout still tends to be much higher than the 0% it should be is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting"&gt;Downs
Paradox&lt;/a&gt;, and most
ways of resolving it rely on people voting on matters other than
self-interest, such as loyalty to the group or candidate, or even just
people think that voting is a Good Thing that should be encouraged and
gone through, even if the benefits to yourself are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we made it even more expensive to vote (or vote freely) by
offering money the other way?&amp;nbsp;When &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172644/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/14/News/Most-Say.Their.Vote.Has.A.Price-3099547.shtml"&gt;a class of NYU students was polled
in
2007&lt;/a&gt;,
two-thirds would exchange their vote for a free year of&amp;nbsp;tuition, half
for a million dollars and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20% were as cheap as an iPod Touch (then
between $300-400).&amp;nbsp;This isn't just good for candidates and my wallet,
a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pedrovicente.org/banho.pdf"&gt;study looking at São Tomé and
Príncipe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;found that
decreasing vote-buying also hurt voter turnout and
increased&amp;nbsp;incumbent&amp;nbsp;advantage - which are bad things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may of course be downsides I'm missing to this, but while we're
working out which-rights-are-worth-how-much it's definitely something to
think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&amp;nbsp;This is about the same odds as getting a straight flush in poker.
Here's the question, did me telling you that make you feel being
executed is more or less&amp;nbsp;likely?&amp;nbsp;Straight flushes are possible, your
chances of seeing one in every game you've ever played or seen are much
higher than the chances of getting one in your first game ever (which as
my odds were over a lifetime is equivalent). Likewise dramatic hands are
more likely to appear &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation"&gt;in film or TV
depictions&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a problem because when I give an example of&amp;nbsp;probability&amp;nbsp;your
brain does a trick where instead of working on the odds, it &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100184181/why-we-need-to-teach-parents-about-risk-and-statistics-in-the-wake-of-the-april-jones-horror/"&gt;tries to
think of an example of the thing
being&amp;nbsp;described&lt;/a&gt;
to assess the likelihood of it happening. Hence me giving the example of
a straight flush makes 0.002% seem far, far more&amp;nbsp;likely&amp;nbsp;than it actually
is.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Basically we're terrible with risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Note: may actually be more likely than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quick assorted Dark Knight Rises thoughts. &amp;nbsp;Looking back at some of
my previous posts like this, my usual opening writing tic is 'I liked
this film, but here's some things that were funny' - so in keeping with
that tradition I liked this film, but here's some things that were
funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="people-of-gotham"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People of Gotham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest critique possible of the film is that its most
thematically rich arena is the one most underused - the siege. &amp;nbsp;To begin
with it's&amp;nbsp;not clear why it's happening at all - the ticking timebomb
lends urgency to the final sequence, but why on earth is there that five
month delay? The real reason is that Bruce must be given realistic time
to overcome his physical and spiritual injuries and return to save the
day, but what’s the in-story explanation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious candidate is giving Gotham the chance to demonstrate it
doesn’t deserve to be saved (a reprise of the boats from the previous
film) - but this is undercut by the very little we see of Gotham’s
citizenry. It’s never really clear how much of Bane’s mob at the end is
imported or was recruited during the siege (it is implied that all along
it’s been fed by the unseen problems of the city though - ‘jobs in the
tunnels’ and all). We only have one character that buys into the
revolution and that’s Selina Kyle’s sidekick, the closest we have to a
class warrior is Selina Kyle herself, who quickly becomes disillusioned
at the results of Bane’s world (could be some fun identity stuff in
here, what’s a thief in a world without property?). Bane makes his deals
with capitalists to move the pieces into place, but where’s his similar
co-option of revolutionaries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am of course committing the classic critic mistake of demanding the
film-maker make a completely different film than the one they chose to
and it’s to the credit of the world building that you could fit a whole
mini-series (one I’d love to see) in what takes place over 15 minutes or
so - but as is, it’s hard to work out what Nolan’s actual take is here.
It’s clear that Bane isn't really in the revolution game and he's using
class conflict as the frayed thread that can be pulled to tear Gotham
apart (he’s almost mocking in handing Gotham ‘back to the people’) but
the film never really resolves if Gotham is in revolution or under
occupation - and there’s a thematic muddle as a result. How does the
film feel about Occupy? The trials for the wealthy? Is this about how
revolutions can go wrong? It might be, but we lack revolutionaries and
the only voices we hear are the ones we know to be disingenuous. Rise,
as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Want-to-Be-a-Part-of-the-Dark-Knight-Rises-Soundtrack-133435573.html"&gt;crowd-sourced
chorus&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;repeatedly
demands, but this isn’t a call to revolution, it's asking a great man to
appear - for an individual to climb out of the pit. The people will ask
for heroes, but they stay off the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-rise-of-robin"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Rise of Robin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at the whole film is as a backstory for Robin (John
Blake, rhymes with Tim Drake - hey!) - what led this young police
officer to throw away his badge and take up the cape and cowl? Heroes in
this mold are are faced on both sides by agents of order and agents of
chaos and it’s the reasons they reject both that define them as
characters - Why doesn’t Bruce just join the police, why is Buffy
ill-suited for the Initiative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this light it’s worth looking at just how little John gets
accomplished in this film. Finds Commissioner Gordon, cool, realises the
masterplan to trap all the police underground (a plan that involves the
police suddenly reversing their previous strategy at the exact same time
as the football game, but anyway), cool but too late to do anything.
Tries to break out the underground cops, that didn’t work out, captured
and then freed by Batman who breaks them out more successfully - that’s
ok because he has a new mission leading an exodus over the bridge, but
that doesn’t work out either. I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing
that one of our main characters spends so much time running around not
accomplishing anything because viewed right that’s part of his
disenchantment. We see the final straw when the rigidity of the police
following orders on the other side dooms the bus full of orphans to
oblivion, but what happened to Blake in the Gotham anarchy that led to
that moment? Again, that would have made an interesting story - but
would have been at the expense of the one that was actually told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="loose-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loose thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object that has been most unnecessarily shaped into a bat: darts.
That has to make them less&amp;nbsp;aerodynamic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1wolaRQrOEAqgpZoj1zMh33CkgSlR3gww7dmqkWAHuIc"&gt;wrote
something&lt;/a&gt;
a few years ago on Gotham as anarchy and Batman relationship with its
institutions to describe different schools of realism, Joker section
is a bit forced but the rest still vaguely holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I swear there’s a line from Catwoman that’s lifted from the Halle
Berry movie, which I’m assuming is a little in-joke, or I made it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also: does she, or anyone else, ever refer to her as Catwoman?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of in-jokes: killer crocs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be interesting if there's ever an extended cut - I'm generally of the
opinion the shorter cut is always the better film, but i'm curious to
know what was left on the cutting room floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did his name have to literally be 'Robin'? It was pretty obvious what
was going on there even without that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap energy that dooms us all is starting to be a bit of a recurring
theme in superhero films: this, Spiderman II, Avengers, any others?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know if they took down some of those doors, they could probably
make a walkway fairly easily.&amp;nbsp;MacGyver&amp;nbsp;wouldn't be stuck in there for
long is all I'm saying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

there's some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#a60"&gt;interesting
discussion&lt;/a&gt;
of if a referendum is required or&amp;nbsp;desirable&amp;nbsp;before reform can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the standard argument that major constitutional change should
require a referendum is the idea that as all three major parties entered
into the last election with a manifesto commitment&amp;nbsp;to Lords reform, no
party has a mandate to&amp;nbsp;implement&amp;nbsp;Lords reform. This is on the face of
it, puzzling - if a policy is so popular that all parties feel
it&amp;nbsp;advantageous&amp;nbsp;to put in their&amp;nbsp;manifesto how can whatever government
results not have a mandate as a result? Here's what was said (or
summarized at the end if you want to skip):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="373"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...The Government's view is that:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;because all three parties were in favour of this, we did not think
that a referendum was justified. When the House of Lords
Constitution Committee looked at referendums, it said that it
thought that abolition of the House of Lords would be a subject on
which you would automatically want to have a referendum, but it did
not say that changing the composition of the House of Lords would be
such a proposition. So, no, we do not think that a referendum is
necessary, and that is why we did not propose it in our draft Bill
or White
Paper&amp;quot;.[&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note438"&gt;438&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;373. Despite the constitutional importance of the subject, the lack
of a clear party division on the issue means that any opposition to
the proposed reform cannot readily be tested at any future election
by voting for one or other candidates seeking election to the House
of Commons. If the Government has its way, the draft Bill will have
become an Act before the next general election, at which the first
tranche of elected Members of a reformed House of Lords would be
seeking election. There is thus no opportunity for the electorate to
provide a mandate for these
proposals.[&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note439"&gt;439&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;374. Mr Christopher Hartigan, who described himself as &amp;quot;a member of
the public with an interest in constitutional matters and Lords
Reform in particular&amp;quot; put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that elections were mentioned in the three manifestoes does
not mean it is the settled view of a party, it is not, or the
majority of members of a party agree with it or that the electorate
want it either. It can be said that the fact that it was in three
manifestos makes it clear that the people had no choice. It should
also be remembered all three parties LOST the election. ... If the
government believe this is the will of the people then it should
proceed on a free vote of their representatives or hold a
constitutional referendum before such important changes are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;377. Professor Vernon Bogdanor told us in oral evidence that a
referendum would be the right way forward because all three parties
proposed an elected Lords in their election manifestos in 2010, so
there was no way for the voter to indicate his or her opinion: &amp;quot;I
think it would be right to hold a referendum on this issue, which I
think is a greater change than the alternative vote system that has
been rejected&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substantial argument here is that&amp;nbsp;politically popular is not the
same as popularly popular, the policy&amp;nbsp;could in fact be a stitch-up among
the political class to deny choice on a certain issue while
the&amp;nbsp;truly&amp;nbsp;popular policy goes unexpressed.&amp;nbsp;The point about mandates is
that they result from the public having made a set of choices of Party A
over Party B, if there was no&amp;nbsp;differentiation, there was no choice to be
made, thus no mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes the maths of mandates somewhat counter-intuitive. If we
imagine rival parties A and B and the mandate for policy X, we end up
with this strange table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="25%" /&gt;
&lt;col width="50%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Party A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Party B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A has mandate for X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Y&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No party has mandate for X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No party has mandate for X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If no party is in support, there is no mandate for X, if every party is
in support, there is no mandate for X.&amp;nbsp;If we take the idea of mandates
seriously for a minute this means if&amp;nbsp;the other side steals your good
idea, then suddenly they've taken away your mandate to implement it.
Does that mean that policy X should be put to a referendum to gain its
mandate? Or if arguing that that's reserved for constitutional issues
(which X may not be),&amp;nbsp;does it mean the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention"&gt;Salisbury
doctrine&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2011/07/04/salisbury-lords-reform-history/"&gt;if it
still
exists&lt;/a&gt;)
shouldn't apply because X doesn't really have a mandate from the nation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to that is a question of how different policies X and Y need to be
before the public can be said to have offered&amp;nbsp;sufficient&amp;nbsp;choice. While
all three&amp;nbsp;manifestos pledged to reform the House of Lords, Labour
differed in requiring a referendum, the Conservatives only committed to
a 'mainly-elected' chamber - are those differentiation enough that
voters had a choice?&amp;nbsp;Labour wanted open-list PR, if the Lib Dems had put
their preference for STV into the manifesto would that have been making
a choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the argument is limited to saying that an issue that would
otherwise require a referendum can go without if the election was fought
out on a very specific set of circumstances, but the general principle
is worth thinking about&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;there are any number of areas where overlap
between the parties is large. &amp;nbsp;The argument is that certain manifesto
combinations shouldn't be given practical&amp;nbsp;significance, but the
fiddlyness of the situation that results seems to argue pretty well that
manifesto&amp;nbsp;commitments&amp;nbsp;shouldn't have practical&amp;nbsp;significance full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ultimately comes down to the old question of what exactly happens
in an election - are we empowering people to decide or people to
deliver? At various times manifestos were certainly viewed as binding -
Stanley Baldwin claimed the 1923 election was held solely to reverse a
manifesto&amp;nbsp;commitment&amp;nbsp;of his&amp;nbsp;predecessor[1. Dennis Kavangh, '&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIV/1/7.extract"&gt;The
Politics of
Manifestos&lt;/a&gt;',&amp;nbsp;Parliamentary&amp;nbsp;Affairs,
34(1),1981 ,p.8] - but Kavanagh argues that this becomes
increasingly&amp;nbsp;untenable&amp;nbsp;in the modern age:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead of the mandate referring to a major issue, governments now
use the term to justify a battery of items in the manifesto, however
picayune they may be. As pledges are fulfilled, so the government
spokesman claims that he has kept faith with the electorate,
regardless of the popularity of the measure. But it is the sheer
number of proposals in modern manifestos which weakens the notion of
the mandate as the conscious support of each manifesto proposal by a
person who votes for the party. It is because voters for a party
simply cannot be expected to be aware of all of the proposals, let
alone agree with them, that Finer makes the charge of &amp;quot;manifesto
moonshine &amp;quot; [2. Ibid. p. 9]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the obvious&amp;nbsp;complaint&amp;nbsp;about the idea of mandates: when
voters enter the voting booth are they really endorsing the&amp;nbsp;entirety&amp;nbsp;of
that party's manifesto? Might their decision perhaps be&amp;nbsp;influenced&amp;nbsp;by
other considerations? Can a party really claim a mandate from the nation
for a vague&amp;nbsp;commitment&amp;nbsp;hidden in a footnote on page five underneath the
'beware of the leopard' sign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it'd be fair to say that today (ignoring fiddly issues such as
the position of coalition agreements) while 'mandate' is thrown around
as a useful bit of&amp;nbsp;language, the predominate mindset is that
governments&amp;nbsp;can do anything they can practically achieve and
that&amp;nbsp;manifestos only have practical, as opposed to political,
significant in odd (and probably doomed) cases like the Salisbury
doctrine - on the basis of the above it's hard to say there's much wrong
with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain a bit unsure if the&amp;nbsp;cancelling&amp;nbsp;maths of mandates is something
that should be taken seriously but given both accepting it and rejecting
it stress the idea of manifesto mandates to breaking point it does
illustrate the underlying concept is a bit fragile and shouldn't be too
heavily relied on.&amp;nbsp;For Lords reform,&amp;nbsp;this means that if a referendum is
needed (and I think would be the last chance for groups like Unlock
Democracy to establish &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/the-public-should-have-the-power-to-veto-elected-lords-not-another-vanity-r"&gt;an alternative
principle&lt;/a&gt;),
a referendum is needed - and that in general we should shy away from
arrangements that give much practical importance to manifesto promises
(while of course being free to politically punish parties for breaking
them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, I
created a single dataset of all votes cast since 1998. Then I made a
list for each eurovision country of all other eurovision countries they
shared a border with. For countries bordering seas, I counted all
countries with reasonable straight lines across the water (erring on the
side of being over generous). From this I created a new variable
representing the degrees of separation between the source and
destination of all votes (where 1 means they share a border, 2 means
there’s one country in the middle and so on). This dataset is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjeRO7qR270JdFhxSHU3ZVBNSG1MTXQ5aHZhZkhZamc#gid=0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust regression shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship at the 1% level where each less degree of separation
between A and B increases the number of points transferred from A to B
by 0.39(±0.068). The exact coefficient varies year on year and the
relationship drops from significance in 1998 and 2001. As the first few
‘hops’ are likely to be the most important (it’s doubtful the hop from 4
to 5 degrees of separation is a serious consideration for anyone), it’s
worth re-running the regression looking only at if countries share a
border or not. From this we get another significant relationship where a
country will give around 1.9(±0.245) more points to countries it shares
a border with than those it won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's nice to have a number on this we’re only explaining a few
percent of the overall vote transfer (2.6% when using all degrees
of&amp;nbsp;separation&amp;nbsp;and 4.6% when only using border/noborder) and it’s not at
all clear that ‘degrees of separation' &amp;nbsp;are the best measurement of
geographic effects. Would the effect be larger or smaller if I was less
generous with borders over seas? Should we be looking at ‘regions’,
countries that share a language? This analysis used all votes cast, but
not all countries are regular players - the relationship might be
different if it was cut down to those who vote every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point rather than plough on, &amp;nbsp;I decided to look up if anyone had
ever done any proper work on&amp;nbsp;eurovision and found that of course they
have and a great common thread in these is some kind of justification
for having bothered to study something like Eurovision in the first
place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253"&gt;Yair&lt;/a&gt;
is arguing Eurovision can be used to create a cultural structural
analysis of the post iron-curtain Europe and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071"&gt;Fenn et
al&lt;/a&gt; that the
&amp;quot;Eurovision&amp;nbsp;network&amp;nbsp;is analogous to a range of other complex dynamic
networks involving&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;exchange&amp;nbsp;of goods and opinions&amp;quot;...which are
clearly just excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071"&gt;Fenn, Suleman, Efstathiou and
Johnson&lt;/a&gt; (2006) looked at
Eurovision as a network in terms of &amp;nbsp;how in sync countries are with each
other i.e. how similarly are their votes distributed when you ignore
their votes towards each other. They found that the UK was actually the
most 'in sync' with&amp;nbsp;Europe&amp;nbsp;in general between 1992 and 2003 and while
there were patterns that vindicated my geographical links such&amp;nbsp;Estonia
being associated with the Nordic countries, others raise serious
problems with it such as Spain being absent from the group that includes
France and&amp;nbsp;Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253"&gt;Yair&lt;/a&gt;(1995
- so an older study of a very different eurovision) similarly look at
network effects breaks down eurovision countries into &amp;quot;five meaningful
cliques&amp;quot;, which are further combined into Western, Northern and
Mediterranean blocs (where the last feels like a 'and the rest' bloc)
and that the then supremacy of countries in the Western Bloc was a
result of three of the most&amp;nbsp;strongly&amp;nbsp;knit cliques are located within it.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=884379"&gt;Ginsburgh and
Noury&lt;/a&gt;(2004)
is the closest to a more developed version of my attempt, looking at the
effect of cultural and linguistic proximity (which geographic proximity
would at best be acting as a proxy for) on points and finding that a)
these are important factors that far exceed the effects of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling"&gt;logrolling&lt;/a&gt; and b) that the
'quality' of the song tends to have quite a large effect on the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in a most boring answer, Eurovision turns out to be actually about
the music. But that's the numbers for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/media/1475149/s-s%20marriage.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to
the consultation&amp;nbsp;on same-sex marriage caused some waves this week.&amp;nbsp;Given
the debates inside the church on homosexuality that the response isn't a
heartful endorsement isn't a huge surprise, but it's always a little bit
disappointing to be reminded that an organisation still so entwined with
the state holds these views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well worth a read though, even if you find their arguments
unconvincing it's filled with interesting facts - did you know that you
have a right to be wed in your parish church and the vicar has to
perform it, regardless of your religious affiliation (or lack thereof)?
'The church will be forced to marry people!' has been out of the bag for
a while apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a few sections in particular worth pulling out.&amp;nbsp;The response
opens claiming that that the church has actually been pretty progressive
on same-sex couples in general but marriage is something that needs
special consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;We have supported various legal changes in recent years to remove
unjustified discrimination and create greater legal rights for same
sex couples and we welcome that fact that previous legal and
material inequities between heterosexual and same-sex partnerships
have now been satisfactorily addressed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out a few times, this is a pretty generous
interpretion of the Church's history on the matter. Their contribution
to the Civil Partnership Bill in 2004 was notable for six bishops trying
to help &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://politicsinspires.org/2012/05/history-written-and-rewritten/"&gt;sink
it&lt;/a&gt;
with a wrecking&amp;nbsp;amendment, it's&amp;nbsp;only fourteen years since the highest
figures in the church argued that gay people between 16 and 18 having
sex should &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/116865.stm"&gt;remain
criminalized&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;because
dropping the age of consent would send a 'wrong message', and in 2006
they &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6293115.stm"&gt;boldly stood up&lt;/a&gt; for
the rights of the Catholic Church to have more opt-outs allowing
discrimination against same-sex couples.&amp;nbsp;The Anglican community is
hardly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2012/jun/12/church-of-england-gay-marriage"&gt;all on the same side on
this&lt;/a&gt;,
but the direction the church has chosen to use its power is a little
revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the claim that that marriage as currently stands is a
timeless institution that's existed pretty much forever - trying to put
it that arguing&amp;nbsp;against one-man-one-woman marriage is like arguing
against gravity - it's just a fact, that's what&amp;nbsp;marriage&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with almost all other Churches, the Church of England
holds, as a matter of doctrine and derived from the teaching of
Christ himself, that marriage in general – and not just the marriage
of Christians – is, in its nature, a lifelong union of &lt;strong&gt;one man
with one woman&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a move would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the
union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions
&lt;strong&gt;throughout history&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;strong&gt;history&lt;/strong&gt;, in the laws of the land and in the Church of
England‘s Book of Common Prayer on which the laws concerning
marriage are grounded, marriage has been &lt;strong&gt;understood to be, always
and exclusively, between a woman and a man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic nature of marriage, as enshrined in human institutions
&lt;strong&gt;since before the advent of either church or state&lt;/strong&gt;, is the union
of a man and a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage affords many benefits to society, which include
&lt;strong&gt;mutuality&lt;/strong&gt;, fidelity and &amp;nbsp;biological complementarity with the
possibility of procreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another case where there's quite a substantial clash with
reality. Quite a few cultures have accepted definitions of marriage
outside of this, same-sex&amp;nbsp;marriage has existed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions"&gt;various forms at
various
times&lt;/a&gt;, and
polygamous&amp;nbsp;cultures are&amp;nbsp;hardly rare - awkwardly several of them
documented this fact in their holy books and as a result there are
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/mar_bibl0.htm"&gt;eight kinds of
marriage&lt;/a&gt; sanctioned
in the Bible. While none of them are same sex as such, many differ from
the &amp;quot;lifelong union of&amp;nbsp;one man with one woman&amp;quot; as has existed &amp;quot;before
the advent of either church or state&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentioning 'mutuality' is an interesting point, because that's one
aspect of marriage that even within the Church's (relatively short)
history hasn't been constant. &amp;nbsp;On page 2 they cite a definition
of&amp;nbsp;marriage&amp;nbsp;from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts.aspx"&gt;Common
Worship&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which
draws heavily on the marriage vows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;The Church of Christ understands marriage to be, in the will of
God, the union of a man and a woman, for better, for worse, for
richer for poorer, in sickness and in health,&amp;nbsp;to love and to
cherish, till parted by death.&amp;quot; (Common Worship: Pastoral Services,
page 177)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we go back to&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/the-form-of-solemnization-of-matrimony.aspx"&gt;the Book of Common
Prayer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cited
above&amp;nbsp;we quickly find a departure from this&amp;nbsp;mutuality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.&amp;nbsp;WILT&amp;nbsp;thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
love her, comfort her, honour, and keep her, in sickness and in
health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long
as ye both shall live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Man shall answer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then shall the Priest say unto the Woman,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.&amp;nbsp;WILT&amp;nbsp;thou have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together
after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou
&lt;strong&gt;obey him, and serve him&lt;/strong&gt;, love, honour, and keep him, in sickness
and in health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto him, so
long as ye both shall live?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Woman shall answer,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/marriage.aspx"&gt;revised Common
Worship&lt;/a&gt;
this has been ironed out and 'obey' banished to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/pastoral/marriage/alternativetexts.aspx#vows"&gt;alternative
vows&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(where
'serve' is nowhere to be found not technically being part of the vows in
the original). Now this shift isn't that&amp;nbsp;obscure&amp;nbsp;or hidden knowledge,
but that the mutual character of marriage is a somewhat modern
institution is something that the church should remember. They haven't
been protecting a perfectly Christian conception of marriage while the
rest of society muddled and changed it's definitions - they've been
right here with us as marriage evolved into what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next one is my favourite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To argue that this is of no social value is to assert that men and
women are simply interchangeable individuals. It also undermines
many of the arguments which &lt;strong&gt;support the deeper involvement of
women in all social institutions&lt;/strong&gt; on the grounds that a society
cannot flourish without the specific and distinctive contributions
of each gender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful argument that same-sex marriage undermines arguments
against sexism. After all, if we need women in every boardroom don't we
need them in every&amp;nbsp;marriage?&amp;nbsp;This is of course all the less convincing
coming from an organisation that is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18157584"&gt;at this very
moment&lt;/a&gt; fudging the entry of
women into its corridors of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To round it off the annex plays some interesting games with definitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only kind of marriage which English law recognises is one which
is&amp;nbsp;essentially &lt;strong&gt;the voluntary union for life of one man with one
woman to the exclusion of all others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That institution would be one which was defined &lt;strong&gt;as the voluntary
union for life of any two persons&lt;/strong&gt;. English law would, as a result,
cease to provide or recognise an institution that represented the
traditional understanding of marriage as the voluntary union for
life of one man with one woman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the established institution of marriage, as currently defined and
recognised in English law, would in effect, have been abolished and
replaced &lt;strong&gt;by a new statutory concept which the Church – and many
outside the Church – would struggle to recognise as amounting to
marriage at all. A man and a woman who wished to enter into the
traditional institution of marriage would no longer have the
opportunity to do so.&lt;/strong&gt; Only the new, statutory institution, which
defined a &amp;nbsp;marriage‘ as the voluntary union of any two persons,
would be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, in the past marriage was between 'a man and a woman' now it'll
be between 'two persons' - this will totally ruin it for all those
couples that are made up of a man and woman but contain no persons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to pin down why but I find this is one of the most
distasteful&amp;nbsp;arguments in the whole thing. &amp;nbsp;What they're implying here is
that there's&amp;nbsp;harm in some way being done to heterosexual married couples
-&amp;nbsp;that the marriage they had no longer existed, its gone, erased with a
pen-stroke, replaced by a ghoul that wears its face but isn't the same
at all. It crosses the line from inventing history to inventing harm,
and there's something ugly in that.&lt;/p&gt;

Independence&amp;nbsp;Referendum&amp;nbsp;debate recently&amp;nbsp;and thought it was probably
worth getting all my notes somewhere in a coherent form.&amp;nbsp;I've&amp;nbsp;shied&amp;nbsp;away
from developments on the substance of independence or devolution towards
issues relating the process and form of the referendum itself (and the
post is large enough just focusing on those questions). The following is
based on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence"&gt;an&amp;nbsp;event at the Constitution
Unit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with

Hazell&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/"&gt;Alan Trench&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and two
panels before the Scottish Affairs Committee, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10452"&gt;one quizzing
academics&lt;/a&gt;
(for the purposes of this post, Panel A) and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523"&gt;the other quizzing both
sides of the AV
campaign&lt;/a&gt;
(Panel B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panel A:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vernon Bogdanor, Research Professor at King’s College London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor John Curtice, Professor of Politics University of Strathclyde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Kellner, President, YouGov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Iain McLean, Official Fellow in Politics, Nuffield College,
University of Oxford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panel B:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Elliott&amp;nbsp;- Campaign Director of NOTOAV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie Ghose - Chair of Yes To Fairer Votes, Chief Executive of Electoral
Reform Society (ERS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;William&amp;nbsp;Norton -&amp;nbsp;Responsible Person for NOTOAV&amp;nbsp;and referendum agent for
No campaign for NE Referendum 2004&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willie Sullivan - Head of Field Operations for yes to fairer votes,&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;director of Electoral Reform Society (ERS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've also included some brief comments from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=9307"&gt;the Electoral Commission
evidence&lt;/a&gt;,
but for the most part the debate has changed enough to make much of that
session irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="role-of-the-electoral-commission"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of the Electoral Commission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general consensus from Panels A &amp;amp; B that the currently proposed
question is unfair, but Curtice points out that Electoral Commission
corrections haven't always been completely&amp;nbsp;unobjectionable&amp;nbsp;so wouldn't
go as far as to make the commission's comments on questions binding.
Along those lines&amp;nbsp;Norton argued it'd be unnecessary as proceeding with
a&amp;nbsp;question&amp;nbsp;the Electoral Commission had labelled dodgy would be a gift
to the&amp;nbsp;disadvantaged&amp;nbsp;campaign anyway so sufficient political incentives
exist without mandating use of the electoral commission formulation.
&amp;nbsp;Kellner made the case that the question doesn't actually make that much
difference, something interesting for a pollster to say as question
effects can have a large effect on how people answer. &amp;nbsp;However I can see
there being a case for not applying polling logic to referenda as most
voters will be exposed to the campaigns long before the ballot and so
question-wording effects could be far less strong than in polling. &amp;nbsp;He
argued what was far more important was that the question be&amp;nbsp;perceived&amp;nbsp;to
be fair, and the Electoral Commission role in this regard
is&amp;nbsp;creating&amp;nbsp;demonstrable&amp;nbsp;justice rather than creating an unproblematic
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a general feeling in panel A however that in the event of
referendum where there might be other&amp;nbsp;contentious&amp;nbsp;structural issues
other than the question (such as the form of questions and counting
system to choose between three or more options) that the commission's
advisory role should be expanded to include those issues.&amp;nbsp;In Panel B
there was opposition&amp;nbsp;to the idea of the electoral commission producing
more material, with both sides pointing out they objected to the neutral
material during the AV campaign. Sullivan argued that it probably wasn't
cost-effective and the money might be better spent on more broadcasts -
which Elliot argued there should be more of, but shorter to fit in
better with how people understand adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="does-a-yes-no-format-matter"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does a 'yes/no' format matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Scottish First Minister Lord McConnell has suggested &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9141435/Lord-McConnell-Hold-referendum-on-straight-question-within-18-months.html"&gt;that
votes should select from
duelling&amp;nbsp;statements&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(i.e.
something like 'Scotland should be an independent country'', 'Scotland
should remain part of the UK'') rather than answering a yes/no question
to&amp;nbsp;deprive the SNP of the advantage of running a 'yes' campaign, but
from the AV teams there wasn't an impression that this was hugely
important.&amp;nbsp;Elliot argued that actually yes/no isn't hugely important (or
at least that slanting is variable on economic conditions and national
mood rather than an inherent bias either way) and the debate can still
be defined in those terms even if the question isn't, with the example
of how the 1997 Scottish referendum was covered by the media as a yes/no
campaign despite it a question of&amp;nbsp;duelling&amp;nbsp;statements. Sullivan thought
that the big difference was 'change/status quo' which exists however the
question is worded, and that the advantage will rest with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;status
quo. The take away message here being that there probably isn't a lot of
point in trying to avoid a 'yes/no' question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="should-there-be-multiple-options"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should there be multiple options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellner said it would be 'perverse' if some kind of devo-max wasn't an
option and as Bogdanor&amp;nbsp;nicely put it &amp;quot;it'd be very odd that an
instrument designed to discover what Scottish people think
should&amp;nbsp;exclude&amp;nbsp;the option that they most favour&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;Trench argued that
most Scots want around 65% change which is closer to independence than
not, so it could well in the unionist's interests to put forward a
devolution option and that the current Unionist pursuit of a 'jam
tomorrow' option where a No vote on&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;would be rewarded with
further devolution could well run into a credibility problem&amp;nbsp;as the
recommendations of Calman Commission have yet to pass into law - giving
a bad record for the UK government's ability to proactively manage
further devolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a related point that even if there's only one question on the
ballot, there's still a decent case to be made for having multiple
referendums on that single question.&amp;nbsp;As it was unlikely
that&amp;nbsp;negotiations&amp;nbsp;or consensus on indepedence or even agreement on
certain flavours of devolution could be reached before the vote
(although Kellner pointed out, a lot of it will become apparent within
the&amp;nbsp;campaign)&amp;nbsp;Panel A were quite keen on the need for two referendums,
one enabling&amp;nbsp;negotiations&amp;nbsp;and another post-negotiations&amp;nbsp;binding
referendum for agreement to terms and Trench &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scotland-may-need-two-referendums-and-process-is-flawed-expert-claims-1-2179480"&gt;similarly supports
this&lt;/a&gt;.
In Panel B, Sullivan indicated that the ERS wasn't&amp;nbsp;wholly supportive of
that (or at least, much less than their evidence would suggest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel A raised concerns about the content of Devo-Max, mainly that it's
as yet ill-defined and needs to be more so before the referendum&amp;nbsp;(the
arrival of devo-plus on the scene may or may not change this situation).
Bogdanor put forward that if it's an option it not only needs to be
defined but needs to be shown what is on offer is&amp;nbsp;genuinely&amp;nbsp;an option
from Westminster. Noton pointed out that the North-East devolution,
welsh powers and AV referendums had outcomes that were well-known and
thought out before the election. He argues that it's fundamentally a
unionist proposal and it's up to the unionist side to define it (which
raises the question of who's actually for the status quo, but we'll get
to that in a bit). &amp;nbsp;McLean again argued that it isn't realistic for all
the negotiations to happen ahead of time, hence the idea of a second
confirming referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghose and Sullivan agreed that a three option referendum could probably
have three campaigns, which brings up the issue that the&amp;nbsp;Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 &amp;nbsp;(PPERA) has an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108"&gt;'all or
nothing'
rule&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for
having a&amp;nbsp;designated&amp;nbsp;lead campaign, something that could be interesting
in a three-way referendum as it's not at all clear who the groups that
would argue for each option would be - you'd expect a common unionist
position to emerge and it's not clear if that would be devo-max or the
status quo. Depending on the exact details of a devolution option, there
might of course be a three-way split but in the event that this doesn't
happen it's not clear if any lead campaigns are allowed (Referendum
legislation could of course amend PPERA to allow a minimum of two).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-should-a-multi-question-referendum-be-conducted"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should a multi-question referendum be conducted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;terms&amp;nbsp;of precedent, the New Zealand electoral system&amp;nbsp;referendum&amp;nbsp;was
mentioned by Kelner, Sullivan and Hazell as an example of how a
multi-option referedum might be conducted.&amp;nbsp;This is is one sense good
precedent being a multi-option referendum from a&amp;nbsp;Westminster&amp;nbsp;style
parliamentary democracy, but as it's the&amp;nbsp;example&amp;nbsp;that comes up again and
again it does illustrate that this is relatively new ground and the door
is open for pretty much anything to happen here and
create&amp;nbsp;precedent.&amp;nbsp;Kellner also pointed out the 1997 Scottish devolution
referendum was effectively a three option vote, so it's not completely
without UK&amp;nbsp;precedent, although in this case all three camps would
stronger options. Similarly Norton brought up the North East 2004
referendum as an example but also pointed out as the second question was
a&amp;nbsp;subsidiary&amp;nbsp;question, all campaigning focused on the first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SNP's double question (the problems with which I went into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
seems to have mostly gone away at this point and Panel A were divided on
the best way to go foward. Kellner has previously written something
helpful about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/"&gt;five possible ways of doing
this&lt;/a&gt;and
he and McLean both favoured a ballot that allowed people to rank '1' and
'2' which is then counted by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method"&gt;Condorcet
method&lt;/a&gt;. In the
unlikely event of a Condorcet loop, McLean would want something in the
referendum legislation to deal with it and suggests defaulting to the
status quo. Bogdanor&amp;nbsp;suggested a three option ballot with a later
run-off election and Curtice a gateway question approach, with the first
question giving a choice for&amp;nbsp;independence and if that fails, question
two giving the choice between status quo and devo max.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The ERS favours
a different gateway question, with the first being a question about
change in principle, the second then being a choice between the two
change options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alan Reid called Sullivan on, the problem with the ERS question is it
only allows the status quo to a voter's first or last preference and
'Devo Max, status quo, independence' is a perfectly likely ordering (and
such a voter could end up empowering their least favoured option by
voting in accordance with their most) - a similar problem holds for
Curtice (it's the flaw of the gateway question in&amp;nbsp;principle) but in this
case it's&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;that can only be placed first or last, something
that's possibly more in key with actual preferences.&amp;nbsp;McLean and Kellner
were opposed to runoffs and AV on the grounds that&amp;nbsp;an option like Devo
Max could be the Condorcet winner and the consensus choice but if it
came third in the first round it'd be removed.&amp;nbsp;Panel B very briefly
ventured onto this territory giving us the memorable moment of a former
member of the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign&amp;nbsp;saying &amp;nbsp;'it wouldn't work'
but alas they didn't go further into it.&amp;nbsp;Trench questioned if you could
get a mandate from&amp;nbsp;preferential&amp;nbsp;voting, but this would presumably be
less of an issue with a run-off referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="election-timing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Election Timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogdanor argues that the referendum should happen sooner rather than
later as the issues aren't that complicated and the continued
uncertainty could be causing economic damage (a point he'd repeat from
the audience at the Con Unit). McLean argued in response that the
biggest economic issue is currency for&amp;nbsp;Scotland's&amp;nbsp;large financial
industry - and that this is an issue that could be addressed (and there
is incentive for both sides to do so) well before the referendum, making
timing less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazell disagreed with Bogdanor that economic grounds were enough to
justify Westminster interference in picking a date, and argued
that&amp;nbsp;there are two legitimate concerns for the UK&amp;nbsp;government&amp;nbsp;regarding
the time - avoiding a day that clashes with another election, and also
one that would come close to the next general election as this would
create &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/07/scottish-referendum-date-matters?"&gt;constitutional
awkwardness&lt;/a&gt;
in the event of a vote for independence if a general
election&amp;nbsp;occurred&amp;nbsp;between the yes vote and independence - Scottish MPs
would be returned and potentially help form a&amp;nbsp;government&amp;nbsp;before
disappearing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that a date should be picked with regard to being able to
wrap up potential&amp;nbsp;negotiations&amp;nbsp;before May 2015 - however the assumption
here is that the fixed parliament will last that long &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;over at the LSE
Politics and Policy blog Patrick Dunleavy is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2012/02/20/general-election-2014-dunleavy/"&gt;not at all
convinced&lt;/a&gt;
that the coalition will go the distance, expecting a dissolution and
Conservative and Labour agreement on an early election sometime in 2014
- in which case it's probably too late to avoid the problem above.
However this exact question and an ongoing referendum through 2014 might
actually either reinforce the&amp;nbsp;coalition&amp;nbsp;or at least
create&amp;nbsp;disincentives&amp;nbsp;for Labour to agree to dissolve&amp;nbsp;parliament (Keeping
Scotland in the union is strongly in the party's interest and may
deplete campaigning funds to an extent that they don't want to run a
general election the same year) and&amp;nbsp;hence make the&amp;nbsp;coalition&amp;nbsp;more likely
to run it's full course - so it's possibly everything cancels out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related time issue is the length of control period and the campaign
in general, which there was a general consensus in panel B that a longer
period was better and that the campaign needed at least twelve months.
&amp;nbsp;Norton&amp;nbsp;argued&amp;nbsp;that 10 weeks control period simply wasn't enough time to
deal with the&amp;nbsp;practicalities and time taken along the critical path to
the free post mailshots - in 2004 his campaign almost missed the
deadline and the NotoAV campaign this time around started printing
before they were&amp;nbsp;officially&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;designated&amp;nbsp;campaign.&amp;nbsp;The main problem
(that's probably&amp;nbsp;unresolvable) with referenda as opposed
to&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;parliament&amp;nbsp;elections (and now&amp;nbsp;possibly Westminster) is
there's no fixed time for the election to work towards and there’s an
incentive to do what the SNP are doing and have a long pre-legislation
period (still &amp;nbsp;a year to go before that according to their timetable)
where campaign actions can’t be monitored because
there’s&amp;nbsp;officially&amp;nbsp;nothing to campaign about going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="franchise"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Franchise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bogdanor thinks the voting age should be 16, but
that&amp;nbsp;referenda&amp;nbsp;shouldn't be special and the existing&amp;nbsp;franchise&amp;nbsp;should
apply. Curtice argues that changing the francise would be opening a can
of worms in terms of ideas about nationality and that&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it'd be
technically difficult to get people on the register anyway. Andrew
Scallan (Director of Electoral Administration at The Electoral
Commission)&amp;nbsp;spent a long time not wanting to give a precise answer as to
how long the process of expanding the registers would take (more than
week, less than a year) but did suggest the best scenario would be
legislation in the summer followed by a household canvas in the
Autumn,&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;at other times of year the process might be more
difficult/result in a less complete register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly as it's a local government francise EU citizens would be
able to vote but as typically they're bared from national elections
(which elections for a&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;parliament would become in the event of
an independence win) means that they could effectively vote to remove
their own representation. Curtice points out however that they're
unlikely to vote at all so it's a bit of a moot point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="reduction-of-westminster-mps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduction of Westminster MPs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've moved this section into
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2012/03/seats-for-powers/"&gt;a&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="status-of-rest-of-uk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status of rest of UK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of the rest of the UK in this decision is&amp;nbsp;variable&amp;nbsp;on outcome,
Mclean argues that Scotland could declare independence&amp;nbsp;unilateral&amp;nbsp;but
could not declare devo max&amp;nbsp;unilateral, as devolution would be a gift of
powers from Westminster. This distinction is less than it seems though
as the kind of independence that the SNP describes includes some quite
complex inter-dependence that would similarly require UK consent.&amp;nbsp;Trench
said that a referendum on devo-max could include the rest of the UK &amp;nbsp;(I
think I'd be correct in describing his view as falling far shorter than
'should'), Hazell was content that it could be negotiated by the
government. If the&amp;nbsp;precedent&amp;nbsp;in general has been for referendums to
devolve powers, the&amp;nbsp;precedent&amp;nbsp;is also that only the affected region
votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="will-the-english-bomb-scottish-airports"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=10523"&gt;AV Campaigns
evidence&lt;/a&gt;
for the Scottish Affairs Committee, David Mowat (Conservative
MP)&amp;nbsp;brought up in passing the idea that devo-max could involve an
element of reduction of&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;seats in&amp;nbsp;Westminster&amp;nbsp;in exchange for
powers, an idea that's appearing in a few places (just a few examples,
this&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ditchley.co.uk/page/384/annual-lecture-xlvii.htm"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by
John Major and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828"&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;
in the&amp;nbsp;Scotsman) and I thought it was worth branching off this
discussion into a new post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one level the position is understandable,&amp;nbsp;reducing seats was how
historically devolution used to work with a reduction in Irish seats
when home rule was introduced in 1921.&amp;nbsp;The idea that seat allocation was
related to national status received more&amp;nbsp;systematic&amp;nbsp;backing at the 1944
Speaker's Convention where the principle was agreed that there was a
case for &amp;quot;substantial representation&amp;quot; of a&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;nation beyond what
mathematical divisions would provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However now the principle of electoral equality has completely swept
this approach away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trace the most&amp;nbsp;official&amp;nbsp;examples, the idea of reducing Scottish and
Welsh seats pops up several times in the Justice Committee
Report&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmjust/529/529i.pdf"&gt;&amp;quot;Devolution: A Decade
On&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
the most precise formulation is cited from a Constitution Unit Report by
Robert Hazell: &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/publications/tabs/unit-publications/141.pdf"&gt;Towards a New Constitutional Settlement: An Agenda for
Gordon Brown’s First 100 Days and
Beyond&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One partial solution Gordon Brown could consider is to harmonise the
electoral quotas of the four UK territories, ending English
under-representation, or even to reduce the representation of
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to two-thirds that of
England*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*This solution has historic precedent in that during the operation
of the Northern Ireland Parliament (1922-72) Northern Ireland had 12
MPs, &amp;nbsp;rather than the 18 its population demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Committee Report is a little sly in this respect, reframing
this as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The latter approach was taken when the 1922 Parliament of Northern
Ireland was created, and Northern Ireland MPs were reduced to
twelve. In 2005 the number of Scottish MPs was reduced from 72 to
59. (pp. 61-62)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication being that the 2005 reduction is another example of the
principle at work in the Northern Ireland example when it's actually
just a delayed&amp;nbsp;consequence&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;Scotland Act 1998, which I'd argue is
working under quite different principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in a crude way the Act could be seen as being a 'seats for powers'
transaction as it both create a devolved body and decreases seats (that
link &amp;nbsp;is made pretty explicitly by that piece in
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/edinburgh-evening-news/opinion/jim_sillars_devo_is_in_the_detail_for_alex_1_2062828"&gt;Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;),
but the method it uses to do so is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reduction in seats removes the minimum of 71 seats and a
separate&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;quota, ending over-representation of Scotland - but
the method used more&amp;nbsp;represents a principle of electoral equality
by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/86"&gt;syncing the Scottish&amp;nbsp;electoral&amp;nbsp;quota with the English
quota&lt;/a&gt;,
something that was repeated and taken further with&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/1/part/2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;the creation of a
UK-wide quota&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by
the&amp;nbsp;Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend through these changes has been an effective reduction of seats
in devolved regions (or will be if the current boundary proposals are
ever passed), but the justifying principle in these cases was &amp;quot;one
person, one vote&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;seats for powers&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;Each&amp;nbsp;successive&amp;nbsp;change has
been in favour of greater and stricter stress being giving
to&amp;nbsp;mathematical equality on constituency apportionment, so to at this
point give Scotland less representation because of greater devolution
would be a step backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there's historical&amp;nbsp;precedent&amp;nbsp;it's worth considering that how we
understand seats and apportionment has undergone&amp;nbsp;enormous&amp;nbsp;shifts since
1921.&amp;nbsp;Today the idea that national representation should be considered
is completely lacking from the law governing apportionment.&amp;nbsp;It's also
not at all clear it resolves the problems it's supposed to address. Is
the West Lothian question really resolved by slightly fewer Scottish MPs
voting on English matters?&amp;nbsp;Similarly, on matters like defence and
foreign affairs, there's no particular reason why Scottish voices should
matter less on the issues they would still return MPs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a compromise to save the union it could be a short-lived one. &amp;nbsp;In
answer to a question on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/scottish-independence"&gt;his
presentation&lt;/a&gt;
at the Constitution Unit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://devolutionmatters.wordpress.com/"&gt;Alan
Trench&lt;/a&gt; put forward that
devo-max might be an unstable position as foreign policy can often be a
wedge issue &amp;nbsp;- would this situation be better or worse if Scotland had a
legitimate&amp;nbsp;grievance&amp;nbsp;of unequal representation in crafting that policy
added to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the practical side assuming an 'English votes on English issues'
rule, Scottish MPs would be left with far less to do (especially if
their ability to sit on committees is restricted) and their non-voting
functions probably could be done by fewer MPs.&amp;nbsp;If so reducing their
number would seem to be a good idea not only to avoid waste, but to
ensure the job is still active enough to attract good candidates. But
how can this be done while still respecting voter equality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;the idea of an MP's vote from their physical
person.&amp;nbsp;Scottish voters are entitled to have their votes weighed the
same as those in the other nations - but Scottish MPs don't need to have
the same voting power as other MPs. The voting power of Scottish MPs
could be increased to&amp;nbsp;allow both a reduction in numbers and also
preserve&amp;nbsp;mathematical&amp;nbsp;equality (for a reduction of 2/3 this would give
Scottish MPs a vote worth one and a half their current vote, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weighted voting isn't a new idea in principle but it's one that's rarely
been used in the UK - I think it's a good one to think more about in
this case as it allows respect for both voter equality and the fact that
more devolution will have practical effects at Westminster.&lt;/p&gt;

clearly a&amp;nbsp;thematic reaction to 9/11 and the 'post 9/11 world'
(complaints about how its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/10/in-which-your-host-gets-angry-and-other.html"&gt;ripped from the headlines
nature&lt;/a&gt;
negate it's own ability to world-build notwithstanding), something I've
started to noticed is sci-fi shows using the imagery of 9/11 in a
distinctive way quite&amp;nbsp;separated&amp;nbsp;from delving into the events themselves.
&amp;nbsp;One of most famous reveals in cinematic sci-fi is from The Planet of
the Apes, where Charton Heston finds the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://movieclips.com/Y72BL-planet-of-the-apes-movie-the-statue-of-liberty/"&gt;Statue of Liberty buried in
the
beach&lt;/a&gt;
and realises this place that he thought was an alien wilderness is in
fact all too familiar. What’s cropping up in a few places now is the
World Trade Center working as the reverse of that, a reveal of a New
York landmark that shows you have left the familiar and entered a
strange, unsettling place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both Fringe and the US-remake of Life on Mars, the presence of the
World Trade Center serves this function, solidifying&amp;nbsp;that characters
have entered a strange new world. In Life on Mars, Sam Tyler seeing the
intact WTC is the crown of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9GNi6tSmc"&gt;the accident
sequence&lt;/a&gt;, finishing his
transition to the alien world of yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/a/Whqtx#0"&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/fringeposter-300x82.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major feature of Fringe is the presence of an alternate universe that
is fundamentally &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjEMKVdSVc"&gt;both similar and different to our
own&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;At the end of the
first season of Fringe, Olivia has travelled to meet the enigmatic
William Bell only to whisked away to somewhere else - the final shot of
the series revealing she has travelled to the other universe and to an
office in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_go1SU1oJ0&amp;amp;t=2m00s"&gt;a still-standing alternate version of the World Trade
Center&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While
the difference in the events of 9/11 are far from the only
feature&amp;nbsp;separating&amp;nbsp;the universes (there’s something interesting about
growing numbers of alternate universes with zeppelins but anyway) it’s
used as a continuing touchstone for stories involving the other
universe; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvw2L6BKv6k&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;the repeated use of the NY
skyline&lt;/a&gt;,
an architect from ‘Other There’ caught in a fringe event was designing
the New Pentagon, Peter’s visit to a possible future has him arriving at
the base of a completed Freedom Tower, the ‘amber-blue’ Lincoln Lee on
crossing over for the first time&amp;nbsp;doesn't&amp;nbsp;think the other universe seems
that different until he gets his first look at the twin towers - showing
him even though the place is superficially familiar it is deeply alien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://www.alexparsons.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/monoliths-300x85.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their shape they invoke another icon of classic sci-fi: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y15NnGZIBuM"&gt;the
monolith&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;When I first
thought about this I dismissed it as&amp;nbsp;a bit of a trite comparison between
two things that happen to be cuboids - but the way they're used is
actually quite similar; they're deployed as a symbol of strangeness
beyond understanding, something that&amp;nbsp;couldn't&amp;nbsp;possibly exist and yet
does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the past is many ways a different planet is part of the fundamental
conceit of Life on Mars and for all the discussion of whether 9/11
really did &amp;quot;change everything&amp;quot;, it's interesting to see how quickly it's

only exciting to a certain kind of wonk) is how the debates about a
Scottish Independence referendum are systematically going through every
disputed concept in the idea of elections. When is the vote? About what?
How will they vote? Especially disputed is the question of who should
vote: All affected interests? By geography? By blood? And now there's
also the question of if people younger than 18 should be given a say in
their national future. If this goes anywhere, it would be the first UK
referendum which expands rather than contracts the electorate (and would
require the development of a separate voting register for this election
which might be interesting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing still off-limit is breaking the idea that all voters
should count equally - a rule I'll argue further down that breaking
would actually provide quite a neat solution to the problem of lowering
the voting age - but first let's go into the normal arguments for a bit.
Here we have Angela Constance &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/2012/02/01/should-16-and-17-year-olds-vote-in-the-referendum/"&gt;making the case
for&lt;/a&gt;
letting 16 -and 17-year-olds vote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After all, if a 16 year old in Scotland can join the army, get
married and pay taxes – surely he or she should be able to have a
say in this country’s future? That is why in the consultation Your
Scotland, Your Referendum, we are seeking views on extending the
right to vote in this referendum to 16 and 17 year olds who are
eligible to be included on the electoral register.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the usual trio brought up to demonstrate the unfairness of the
current voting age. The object here is to show that we are in some way
being inconsistent in handling the maturity of 16 year olds without
relying on the slippery slope of 'maturity'. In Scotland the marriage
thing holds (In England and Wales there's a parental consent requirement
below 18) but the army item has gotten more tenuous as although 16 year
olds can join the army &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.defencemanagement.com/feature_story.asp?id=15592"&gt;they're not actually allowed to deploy anywhere
till they're
18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax argument is worth going into. The idea that there's a connection
between taxation and representation is an old one but not necessarily a
particularly good one to demonstrate inconsistency - being consistent on
it would require us to do far more than allow 16-year-olds to vote. For
a start, we actually let children pay taxes far earlier than 16, any
time a child saves up and buys anything with VAT they're tax-payers.
True at 16 someone can work full time and pay income tax, but there's no
real reason to connect this kind of tax to the franchise and no other.
From the other end we don't take away the right to vote from adult
unemployed people or those in full-time education who similarly have the
potential to be tax-payers but aren't. To be consistent, if it's the
ability to pay tax that's important we must enfranchise anyone who can
earn and spend anything, or if we are treating income tax as a special
case then we need to disenfranchise anyone who is not paying income tax
(in which case the Lib Dem policy of raising the personal threshold
wouldn't be a way of relieving the tax burden on the poorest but a
sneaky way of disenfranchising them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this argument is basically getting at is the idea that we have a
norm for granting a set of rights at 16 and voting rights should be
included in it. This is a helpful argument for advocates of lowering the
voting age because it allows an appeal to precedent and doesn't rely
directly on the nebulous idea of 'maturity' - a problematic idea because
there's inevitably only a small difference between each age cohort
making it hard to draw the process to a stop (if we let 18 year olds,
why not 17? And if them why not 16? And if them, why not... and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with this is that it's hard to see why this logic doesn't
also apply to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/kccentral/yourvoice/yourrights/yourrightsat18.aspx"&gt;any other
right&lt;/a&gt;
gained at 18. The basic challenge of 'we grant right X at 16, how is it
just that we grant right Y at 18?' applies to all of them. If children
are considered mature enough to have opinions on keeping Trident, why
shouldn't they be allowed to buy fireworks? Taken to its conclusion this
is saying is that adulthood begins at 16, not that children should vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's not necessarily anything wrong with this idea, a society based
on this would be different but not unthinkable, but accepting this puts
an end to the idea of graduated maturity. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ann.sagepub.com/content/633/1/141"&gt;Andrew Rehfeld
argues&lt;/a&gt; that the defining
feature of childhood maturity isn't that it is or isn't present but that
it is 'in development' and I think this chimes with how many people
instinctively feel about the subject. Many 16 year olds are on average
probably mature enough to be citizens, but 18 year olds are on average
more so and 14-year-olds on average less so - hence a structure that
grants legal rights at intervals and removes qualifications on rights as
a person ages seems to fit nicely into this. So given this, how should
voting rights be handled? Highest bundle? Lowest? Rehfeld leans on the
idea of California state senator John Vasconcellos, who argued that
rather than debate at which point we turn on voting rights, we should do
it gradually and give fractional votes to citizens under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehfeld actually goes far further than most child voting supporters, not
simply arguing that 16-year-olds should have half a vote until they turn
18, but that we should go far lower and each year from 12 a person
should gain 1/7 of a vote until they have their full vote at 18
(Vasconcellos's fractions were &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Wheels_for_Citizenship"&gt;different but same basic
idea&lt;/a&gt;).
The basic idea of gradualism I think is a good one because it sidesteps
the problem of a 'race to the bottom' above as this approach reflects
differences in maturity rather than similarities.&amp;nbsp;Practically the vote
count would be different but not&amp;nbsp;unmanageable&amp;nbsp;and could still be done
with a hand count - at it's most basic you could use&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;registers
for each birth year, colour-code the voting slips and then count these
votes&amp;nbsp;separate&amp;nbsp;from the main piles. Counting the different cohorts in
series would add little difficulty over simply increasing the number of
voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that some people should have greater voting power than others is a
commonly-had and commonly-rejected idea. Ultimately that each person has
one vote is a compromise, as any other scheme arguing that certain
citizens are wiser and so should have greater voting powers would not be
generally accepted and so would undermine rather than enrich the
democratic process. I think children are a special case in this sense as
the fractional vote represents a process rather than permanent division.
It's not an argument that a certain race or gender's votes are worth
less, or that any particular&amp;nbsp;qualification&amp;nbsp;should give more voting power
- simply that children start off immature and progress towards maturity
and they should have a voting power that reflects this reality.&amp;nbsp;It
allows for what I think is a reasonably common sense view on the
maturity of children to be expressed, while at the same time recognizing
that children represent real interests (that are distinct from any other
group) and should have a say in matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as a reduced voting block this would still introduce
a&amp;nbsp;sizeable&amp;nbsp;number of people to the electorate so the result is far from
a token vote, and as a result children would grow and be socialized into
citizenship rather than having it thrust on them all at once. This is a
more radical approach than votes at 16, but I think it ultimately
accomplishes the same aims better and - rather than creating a new
voting age with the same justifications waiting in the wings to lower it
again - would create a future-proof framework for dealing with child
voters. Best case, this gives us a political system more tuned to the
needs and concerns of the young (and by proxy, future generations) and
more children who enter adulthood as politically aware individuals.
Worst case, we add a few more voters to the large number who already
have no idea what they're doing. &amp;nbsp;On the basis of that highly slanted
weighing up of the facts, it'd be silly not to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

emerged on the Internet of Boris Johnson being chased outside City Hall
by a man in a chicken suit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out this chicken isn't even chasing the actual Boris, giving
us a man wearing a chicken suit chasing a man dressed a man with a fake
blonde wig, being&amp;nbsp;filmed with a shaky camera for authenticity. It's a
strange world we live in, but stranger still is that following
politicians while wearing chicken-suits has a long and proud&amp;nbsp;history.
&amp;nbsp;As far as I can tell, it started in America when Gerald Ford &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/120064/tales-of-a-serial-prankster-interviewing-the-president-while-wearing-a-chicken-suit/"&gt;addressed
the chicken
mascot&lt;/a&gt;
of a local radio station while on campaign - a New York Times reporter
then promptly bought the costume off the station and showed up to a
press event in it as a prank (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/22347153"&gt;video
here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="/uploads/chicken-300x173.png:target:/uploads/chicken.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicken then went dormant for a while, reappearing in 1992 &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5NGAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=s-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=4586,977613"&gt;working
for
Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(great
illustration in that article) as 'Chicken George', but this time around
the chicken had a political objective. The job of this chicken was hound
George H. W. Bush for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/news/01iht-deba.html"&gt;stonewalling debate
negotiations&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
this has been a recurring use of chicken suits since. This version of
the chicken I'm assuming is the inspiration for events in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/sixth/615fredonia.html"&gt;season six
of the West
Wing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where&amp;nbsp;Josh
Lyman similarly deploys&amp;nbsp;volunteers&amp;nbsp;in chicken suits to hound opponents
who wouldn't debate his candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicken crossed the Atlantic for the 1997 election, giving us the
'Tory Chicken', who followed Tony Blair to highlight that he had
declined to debate John Major. For some reason this triggered a
previously unknown British capacity for animal-suit politics, spawning a
fox to chase the chicken off and a rhinoceros&amp;nbsp;opposed to the idea of
animal suits entirely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicken was to follow the Labour leader, who was campaigning in
the marginal Tory seat held by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary. However, his efforts to henpeck Mr Blair were hampered by
a man from the Scottish Daily Mirror dressed as Freddy the Fox, who
blocked his path during a 15-minute walkabout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mr Blair approached, the chicken was seen to stumble and was
pushed to the back of the crowd surrounding the Labour leader, where
it waved a placard before skulking off. A jubilant Freddy observed:
&amp;quot;I had him for dinner. I stopped him getting anywhere near Tony.
Tony shook my hand and thanked me for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mr Blair's guardian refused to identify himself, saying:
&amp;quot;The whole thing is embarrassing enough as it is.&amp;quot; The incident came
at the end of a traumatic day for the Tory chicken. Earlier, he got
into a nasty fight with a rival chicken with a detachable head, sent
by the Mirror newspaper, as he strutted across College Green in
Westminster. He was also pursued across London by another fox, two
teddy bears and a plastic rhinoceros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/rantext/random-politics/the-tory-chicken-loses-its-head"&gt;That whole
article&lt;/a&gt;
is worth a read if only for the full description of the Chicken's fight
with the Mirror Chicken (the Mirror would go on to send another chicken
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8633049.stm"&gt;after
Cameron&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/09/article-1275443-097E59F4000005DC-503_634x424.jpg"&gt;Clegg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
probably others&amp;nbsp;in the 2010 election).&amp;nbsp;Daniel&amp;nbsp;Finkelstein has a good
story about having to keep the Chicken motivated during the campaign,
but it's sadly now lost behind the Times paywall. In happier
news,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://takingliberties.squarespace.com/taking-liberties/2010/4/18/class-of-97-tony-blair-and-the-tory-chicken.html"&gt;here's the
story&lt;/a&gt;
of its visit to Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chickens have also popped up in
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.canoe.ca/raisinghell/general/doer-smarter-than-your-average-chicken/"&gt;Canadian&amp;nbsp;provincial&amp;nbsp;elections&lt;/a&gt;
so there's a fair chance&amp;nbsp;I've missed several chicken sightings but the
idea of using chickens to draw attention to lack of debates (and assign
blame) seem to be a recurring thing here. Given this back story, what do
we make of this latest chicken? &amp;nbsp;That the real Boris doesn't even appear
in Ken's chicken's videos so far (and that it's not explained in video
why there's a chicken) is interesting as the chicken&amp;nbsp;usually&amp;nbsp;tries to
muscle in on it's target's event and steal the focus.&amp;nbsp;Is chasing fake
Boris a sign of laziness or a sign that the media landscape is changing
and our use of chicken suits with it? &amp;nbsp;Do&amp;nbsp;we now understanding a chicken
suit as short-hand for dodging debates? Or does the lack of context of
the clip&amp;nbsp;reflect the changing face of media, that it's now better to get
a short and intriguing video on the internet and draw people to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.borisjohnshen.com/"&gt;your
site&lt;/a&gt; than to try and worm in at your
opponent's own media events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For entirely unrelated reasons, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/203347/voting-in-nevada-dont-wear-a-chicken-suit"&gt;you can't vote in a chicken-suit in
Nevada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

reports&lt;/a&gt;
that Westminster is claiming a Scottish&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;referendum wouldn't
be able to use the full electoral roll, which seems a bit strange:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland Office Minister David Mundell said: &amp;quot;The UK government has
set out very clearly that the Scottish government cannot legislate
lawfully for a referendum with its current powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The full electoral register can only be used for specific purposes
such as the general or Holyrood elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The legal position is clear - if the SNP attempts to go ahead with
its own referendum then it will be nothing more than an opinion
poll, with a million Scots unable to be asked for their view.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true this means many potential voters could be excluded as they're
not on the&amp;nbsp;publicly&amp;nbsp;available (reduced) register. As a layman I've had a
quick skim of some of the acts related to the electoral register and
according to the explanatory note of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/1872/note/made"&gt;Representation of the People
(Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations
2002&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A copy of the full version of the register may not be supplied by a
registration officer otherwise than in accordance with an enactment
(which, by virtue of the definition in inserted regulation 92(2),
includes subordinate legislation) including the principal
Regulations (inserted regulation 94(3)).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of which includes an enactment to be &amp;nbsp;'any provision of, or
of any instrument made under, an&amp;nbsp;Act of the Scottish Parliament' via
the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/2/contents"&gt;Representation of the People Act
2000&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Which,
again I might be misreading, I take to mean the Scottish Parliament can
in principle have referenda using the electoral roll. If they can use it
for even a non-binding question about a reserved power is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/nov/08/uk-supreme-court-scottish-independence"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Matt Qvortrup&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/cartoon/dr_matt_qvortrup_scotland_does_not_need_permission_to_go_it_alone_1_2047506"&gt;sort of
argues&lt;/a&gt;in
the Scotsman, the international recognition of self-determination (which
I think is less strong than he suggests, but going with it) would likely
mean in the event that Scotland holds a democratically legitimate but
illegal referendum, it would likely have to be recognised by Westminster
- which is why moves to&amp;nbsp;de-legitimize&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;potential&amp;nbsp;vote by arguing
people will be excluded make sense, and as I've said before the SNP
should be careful to avoid &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smokefilledroom.co.uk/2011/11/scottish-independence-ballot-design/"&gt;ambiguous questions that give rise to these
kinds of
challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newsnetscotland.com/index.php/referendum/4093-conservative-scaremongering-over-electoral-register-dismissed-as-qnonsenseq"&gt;clearer
copy&lt;/a&gt;
of SNP statement that seems to support my point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
However a spokesperson for the Scottish government rejected Mr
Mundell's and noted that the referendum would be carried out after
the appropriate legislation was passed at Holyrood, ensuring full
access to the register.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rossiter&lt;/a&gt;
at the Constitution Unit yesterday on the in-progress boundary reviews
(their slides at link). It was interesting in the sense that it
confirmed with figures the kind of problems they’d previously predicted
with the review and I’m just going to throw down a few notes while it’s
fresh in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="building-blocks-and-displacement"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building blocks and displacement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review represents the triumph, though possibly only temporarily, of
the mathematical principle (all constituencies should have equal numbers
of electors) over the organic principle (constituencies should reflect
real communities and locations) with a tighter than ever constraint on
elector numbers. A basic problem of requiring constituency electors to
fall within a certain range is that the building block used (wards) are
too often too big to construct constituencies within the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the English and Scottish commissions have different ways
of dealing with this, the English method being to cross borders to make
up the numbers, whereas the Scottish commission splits wards. &amp;nbsp;They
pretty conclusively demonstrated the Scottish method is less disruptive,
measured by relative numbers of ‘suboptimally&amp;nbsp;placed (SP) electors’, who
are electors displaced from the majority of their compatriots in their
local authority, old constituency or ward. This does make sense
intuitively, as crossing borders pushes the imbalance over into the next
region and requires aggregate more slight movements of voters, but it’s
good to have numbers on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that SPs should be minimized is a good measure, but I wonder if
the principle could be extended. If the proposed ‘one review a
parliament’ schedule is kept up, in the worst case you could find voters
who are moved around at every election - another possible measure would
be to try and minimize the number of people who have been SPs more than
once (TSPs?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the general trend is towards larger wards, they suggested using
polling districts as a possible smaller building block. The other option
they suggested in 2009 (with McLean) was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-923X.2009.02053.x/abstract"&gt;postcodes&lt;/a&gt;
(p. 464).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="public-hearings-and-political-effects"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Public Hearings and political effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to hear that the public hearings (essentially
curtailed versions of the public inquires) are still a vehicle for
parties even if their&amp;nbsp;ability&amp;nbsp;to input has been reduced (limited to 40
minute slots). This isn’t entirely surprising as parties have the
greatest interest in the result - I’m going to bring in here a bit here
something I wrote at the time the bill was going through about the
relationship between parties and the inquiries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

 As boundary matters are decided in the UK by the apolitical Boundary
 Commission, what happens is whenever we have a debate about
 apportionment it rapidly becomes a debate about competing metrics of
 fairness, where each side just so happens to align with the position
 that's seen to result in a better deal for them. Natural population
 movement tends to lead to more boundaries that favour Labour over
 time and so in general Labour has been opposed both to frequent
 redistributions and now, very clearly, stricter equalisation. It's
 not a coincidence that it's the same party that postponed the
 acceptance of new boundaries until after the election in 1969 is now
 dragging it's feet in the Lords but equally the Conservative
 position isn't much deeper, if situations were reversed I've no
 doubt we'd see the same in the other direction. However, that a
 position has political advantages doesn't stop it being a correct
 one.

 …

 It's interesting that one of concessions given in the Lords seems to
 be `the return of public
 inquiries &lt;http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/6661493/wheeling-and-dealing-over-the-av-bill.thtml&gt;`__
 as I thought that removing them was one of the more interesting
 elements of the plan. Public inquiries have a number of issues, they
 make the process very time consuming (which is an issue if we're
 going to have to have a review every parliament), tend to increase
 deviations from the quota size, but most importantly public inquires
 are one of the few ways for political parties to influence the
 decision of the Boundary Commission. What you sometimes get is that
 political parties will show up at the Inquiry with alternate plans,
 which as long as they fulfil the commission's criteria better than
 the Commission's own plan it has no grounds to reject on the basis
 that it's more partisan[1. Lots of interesting discussion of this in
 D. J Rossiter, R.J Johnson, and C. J Pattie, The Boundary
 Commissions: Redrawing the UKʼs map of Parliamentary Constituencies,
 (Manchester University Press: Manchester, 2009), pp. 246-262] .
 Being apolitical means it can't consider the political consequences
 of its work, this is far from saying there are none. Given the

&lt;h2&gt;Relationship to electoral system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that was danced around in the Q&amp;amp;A is the way in which the
boundary commission is related to the voting system. In many way the
boundary commission is the dark and complicated back-end of the ‘simple’
FPTP system (or any single-member system like AV) in that single-member
constituencies are smaller than multi-member constituencies, and so are
more vulnerable to population shifts (and the problem of building block
size mentioned earlier), plus the all-or-nothing nature of the systems
make the partisan implications of boundaries a bigger issue than they
might otherwise be. This isn’t a hugely live issue (as was pointed out
the boundary proposals might be unpopular among MPs but changing the
voting system is even more so) but it’s worth remembering it all fits
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While district magnitude and electoral system have effects on the
importance of boundaries, something that’s thought about less is that
ultimately the conflict between the organic and mathematical criteria
are the result of the fixing representative voting weight at ‘1’.
&amp;nbsp;Trying to express both through the same measure (boundaries) inevitably
requires one to be prioritized over the other, what we need to do is
open up another stream to get the information into the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Toplek
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://templelaw.tenintenclients.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toplak.pdf"&gt;proposes&lt;/a&gt;[2.
Link takes you to pdf, but ref is:&amp;nbsp;Jurij Toplak, ‘Equal voting weight of
all: Finally &amp;quot;One Person, One Vote&amp;quot; from Hawaii to Maine?’, Temple Law
Review, Vol. 81, 2008, pp. 123-178]&amp;nbsp;in the context of the US is rather
than endlessly debate methods of dividing seats among the states on the
basis of their population, use any method but then give a state’s reps a
voting power that is equal to the population of that state. Using
representative voting weight as the means of expressing mathematical
equality frees up the boundary process to deviate in size to allow more
‘natural’ constituencies (even extreme deviations in size could then be
permitted within the system without being exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t resolve all the problems of boundaries (safe seats, etc)
but it does resolve the current debate in a much easier (and cheaper)
way. &amp;nbsp;Beyond that fix, [laying with representative voting weight opens
up a whole new realm of possible electoral structures, including methods
of dynamic apportionment which reduce the need for boundary reviews even
further and more exact methods of proportional representation. But
that’s a matter for future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

State&lt;/a&gt;'
for a class, and it&amp;nbsp;occurred&amp;nbsp;to me his basic frame is something that is
useful for&amp;nbsp;explaining&amp;nbsp;various changes in Facebook.&amp;nbsp;One of his recurring
ideas is that the state as it develops&amp;nbsp;homogenizes various features of
the society to allow the 'center' to better gather&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;about its
capacities and so more effectively govern and rule. This goes from grid
cities eliminating the need for local knowledge and maps to navigate, to
standardization on language to remove the need for local interpreters,
the creation of fixed last names for the purpose of tax collection and
so on - devices that are designed to undermine the importance of local
knowledge and make the society more legible to outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent we can see&amp;nbsp;Facebook take similar paths as it
develops, the most obvious example being when the open-ended 'About Me'
text fields (for interests, sports, movies, music etc) were converted
into a system of links to pages (for various interest, sports, movies,
music, etc) where a user selects which links they want to connect to
their profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old system was very local, I can look at my friends' pages and see
what their interests are and&amp;nbsp;vice&amp;nbsp;versa, it's a system for people who
know each other to share&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;with each other. While it works
well for one-on-one human interaction, it has a number of disadvantages
for Facebook's position at the center - to&amp;nbsp;find out if someone has 'X'
as in interest, they have to search their database which is time and
resource consuming as most of their lots of users probably don't mention
'X' at all. In addition to that, what if someone spells it wrong? Or
uses a local label, or a variation on it? In those&amp;nbsp;conditions, there is
an awful lot of&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;inside Facebook that it effectively has no
idea about, because it doesn't have cheap and&amp;nbsp;reliable&amp;nbsp;ways of accessing
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we imagine Facebook as a series of nodes (people, pages), links
between nodes, and prongs (information associated with a single note) -
it is prongs that cause this difficulty for Facebook. From their
perspective it makes sense to try to convert prongs to links because
links are nicely&amp;nbsp;quantifiable&amp;nbsp;and trackable - it's a much simple matter
to find out how many users have linked to 'X', and also how many are
linked to Y'. &amp;nbsp;But this process was a simplification of the range of
expression&amp;nbsp;available&amp;nbsp;to users, done in the interest of making
the&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;present within&amp;nbsp;Facebook&amp;nbsp;more legible to the center. Most
tellingly, similar&amp;nbsp;to how this development in the state is associated
with improved tax collection, better knowledge of its users makes their
knowledge base more valuable to outsiders, who pay Facebook for access
to it. Making people legible is a way of converting them into money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a bit of a side-note from that, Facebook often claims that
all&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;shared with it is entirely&amp;nbsp;voluntary&amp;nbsp;but something you
see sometimes is them attempting to&amp;nbsp;manipulate&amp;nbsp;people to share
certain&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;through UI design. In one of the re-designs last
year, the&amp;nbsp;employment&amp;nbsp;and education fields jumped out of being hidden on
a back page to being the first thing underneath your name, one of the
most important places on the screen and something you'd be prompted to
fill in everytime you visited your own page. &amp;nbsp;I suspect this is a result
of their decision to switch away from networks as a means of
organisation and privacy control - networks were also a source
of&amp;nbsp;information, if you're in the Durham network you're highly likely to
be a current or recent Durham student (and there were briefly corporate
networks for catching graduates and the general public). By removing the
importance of networks, there's no incentive for people to join networks
and share that&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;about their education or employment, hence
the quality of their&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;degraded and they needed to encourage
more people to give them back the&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;they'd lost through these
other means. Now of course, you still choose if you fill it in or not -
but I bet a lot more people did than who would have otherwise, Facebook
isn't neutral or passive about which&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;it wants.&lt;/p&gt;

you&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first installement of Charlie Brooker's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-mirror/"&gt;Black
Mirror&lt;/a&gt; is, if
nothing else, clever.&amp;nbsp;The name of the anthology&amp;nbsp;itself is clever, being
both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&amp;nbsp;indulge&amp;nbsp;their darker selves. &amp;nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&amp;nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&amp;nbsp;massacre.&amp;nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&amp;nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&amp;quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&amp;quot;)&amp;nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&amp;nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&amp;nbsp;Chris Applegate &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp"&gt;points
out&lt;/a&gt; the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf"&gt;Guardian Screen Burn
column&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(
p191)&amp;nbsp;in 2002:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&amp;nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&amp;nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&amp;nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&amp;nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&amp;nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&amp;nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&amp;nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html"&gt;used on the BBC
website&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&amp;nbsp;that their&amp;nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&amp;nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media"&gt;in promotion of Black
Mirror&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;longer&amp;nbsp;stretch&amp;nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&amp;nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[scrippet]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;ALEX CAIRN&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To the Public..&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;MICHAEL CALLOW&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Fuck the public!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;ALEX CAIRN&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-to the Public this would be one man with, to be blunt, questionable
popularity putting personal embarrassment over the life of a young
girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;MICHAEL CALLOW&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He won't even release her anyway, she's probably already dead!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;ALEX CAIRN&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And if she isn't he'll kill her and upload the video, everyone will
see, the world will see, the mood will border on insurrection and you
will be destroyed I guarantee you, utterly destroyed.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;TOM&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The polling bears that out.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;ALEX CAIRN&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You'll not only be a disgraced politician, you'll be a despised
individual, the public, the palace, and the party insist on compliance.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;MICHAEL CALLOW&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Fuck the party!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;ALEX CAIRN&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Refuse, and I've been advised we cannot guarantee your physical
safety. Or that of your family.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[/scrippet]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&amp;nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&amp;nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&amp;nbsp;In this sense it's a&amp;nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&amp;nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &amp;quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pay the licence fee, you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

the police prevented the first OWS protests from
having&amp;nbsp;electronic&amp;nbsp;amplification so to compensate the mechanism of the HM
emerged, where the person currently with the 'mic' would say a short
phrase of their statement, which those around them would shout, before
the speaker moved onto the next phase and so on - there's a good example
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIK7uxBSAS0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to solving the initial&amp;nbsp;amplification&amp;nbsp;problem Mark Lance and
Sydney Levy at the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html"&gt;New APPS
blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;point
out&amp;nbsp;that this has some quite interesting effects on the nature of
discourse through the HMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most interesting about the HM is the way that it shapes the
time and space of a discourse. &amp;nbsp;Of course the most obvious feature
is that it slows things down. &amp;nbsp;Everything is said twice. &amp;nbsp;This is a
mixed blessing, no doubt, stretching out already long consensus
meetings. &amp;nbsp;But at the same time, we must remember that we are
dealing with a huge, diverse crowd of people, many of whom are
completely new to the very idea of directly democratic
decision-making, and none of whom have much experience with this
group. &amp;nbsp;So slowing things down and repeating everything that is said
before it is possible to respond also functions to draw people in
and lends an air of seriousness to the comments of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the practice eliminates side-conversations. &amp;nbsp;If you
participate in the HM, you have to listen so that you can repeat.
&amp;nbsp;You can't be chatting snarkily with your neighbor, or even focusing
on a text. &amp;nbsp;Neither can folks talk over one another as they could
if, say, everyone was mic-ed electronically. &amp;nbsp;The HM can only repeat
one thing at a time. &amp;nbsp;So there is a built in technological
imperative of waiting one's turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HM as a practice seems to function to &amp;quot;decenter&amp;quot; conversation in
large groups. &amp;nbsp;You don't have to be on the stage, at the mic, or in
front to be a part of the conversation of the whole. &amp;nbsp;And even in
the most inclusive groups, the process of coming up to the front
will be disproportionate intimidating to some and, &amp;nbsp;in the case of
some disabilities, physically difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMs on the face of it seems to address the classic problem that people
aren't really listening if they're working out what they're going to say
next by keeping the audience tasked on repeating the current
message.&amp;nbsp;While someone with an electronic mic is addressing a passive
(and non-tasked) audience, they might disengage and begin
side-conversations if they find the speaker uninteresting, or challenge
the speaker for control of the sound-space by shouting or booing.&amp;nbsp;A
tasked crowd is less able to do these things[1. Another possible factor
is that HMs are imperfect methods of&amp;nbsp;amplification&amp;nbsp;and so can't tolerate
as much other noise, and so people are obliged to be quieter to let it
work at all].&amp;nbsp;This raises a question: as the form of the human mic
requires people to take part in other people's words, what do people do
when they disagree with the message?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef01539361fc5a970b"&gt;Dan
Kervick&lt;/a&gt;
gives a possible answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;At least at the GA I attended, it seemed to be understood that
you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;try to repeat even those words you disagreed with.
People were repeating words even as they were giving down twinkles
of disapproval. However, even while repeating the words, you might
not say them with much enthusiasm. Sometimes people would repeat the
words fully, but in a &amp;quot;yada, yada, yada ...&amp;quot; tone of voice. The
force and enthusiasm element of the repeated words seems itself to
be part of the consensus-building aspect of the assembly discourse.
The speaker's rhetorical direction is influenced in some directions
and away from others by the audible and continuous rising and
falling of the assembly's support, and by the twinkles. [...] one
guy got very vulgar and self-indulgent, and the repetition flagged
in energy and took on a tone of &amp;quot;C'mon man, stop being an ass.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not be universal but in this case rather than cancelling or
drowning out the original speaker, people who are part of the microphone
instead &lt;em&gt;modulated&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;the original voice to express their opinion- the
message and dissent to the message become one and the same thing. This
means it isn't content-neutral as a medium, but also that people calling
it &amp;quot;the people's mic&amp;quot; aren't being entirely silly, as there's an extent
to which the crowd can imbue&amp;nbsp;a statement with their own feelings about
that statement (although it clearly can't apply past the people taking
part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the decentering point made
above&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef0154373e0ae7970c"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;in
the comments at APPS make the point that this is a form of amplification
that's slower and so friendlier to those who might not otherwise want to
step up and speak, but at Occupy Patriarchy Lucinda Marshall argues that
the human mic &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://occupypatriarchy.org/2011/11/16/empowering-the-feminist-voice-at-occupy-confronting-the-silencing-of-mic-check-and-other-misogynies-in-the-occupy-movement/"&gt;isn't&amp;nbsp;necessarily&amp;nbsp;that
empowering&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Listening&amp;nbsp;to people yell, “Mic Check!” at Occupy locations
throughout the country, it is hard not to observe that those with
the loudest voices are the ones who really get heard with this
system, and those voices usually are male baritones.&amp;nbsp; Talking to
women here in Washington and also reading reports from elsewhere, it
is clear that many women find this system of having to yell at the
top of your lungs to be one that is an uncomfortable way to
communicate and participate.&amp;nbsp; Some women report being harassed when
they speak, and even of mics being grabbed from them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't seem to be a&amp;nbsp;universal&amp;nbsp;experience but it's a problem that
should qualify descriptions of HM's democratic virtue - &amp;nbsp;for all its
merits it is as heart a means of amplification and that leaves it
vulnerable&amp;nbsp;to existing disparities in voice.&amp;nbsp;Still, it's a method that
has potential to enhance the deliberativeness of public conversation and
open up and democratize (to some extent) the sound-space, and so is far
more than the simple yelling it might appear to be at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this understanding of what the HMs are supposed to do, it becomes
clear that some groups aren't really using them correctly. Case in
point, &amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;group of protesters at Cambridge University used what they
claimed was a &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.defendeducation.co.uk/go-home-david-an-epistle-to-david-willetts"&gt;people's
mic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2011/11/22/selfish-and-deluded/#comments"&gt;shut-down a David Willetts
event&lt;/a&gt;,
but if it was it's a much poorer conception of the mic than the one
emerging as their aim wasn't to conduct discussion but to close it down,
not opening up the sound-space but filling with white noise to make it
unusable.&amp;nbsp;As the form of the human mic becomes better established it'll
be interesting to see if it keeps its original deliberative spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

that's the craziest rule that ever existed. If the king dies they let
his kid be the king - what are the odds that he's not going to be a
piece of shit? That's one of the weirdest things that we've ever done as
a race of people.” &amp;nbsp;- Louis C.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess I wasn’t that excited when it was announced they’re finally
getting round to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544"&gt;ending male primogeniture for the
monarchy&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s good in
principle in the sense that it’s absurd and sexist to say that a
second-born son is going to be a better ruler than a first-born
daughter, it’s also a bit absurd to say the first-born is inherently
going to be better at the job than the second-born. After a bit more
thought though, I realised that if you look at it from the other
direction (who it keeps off the throne) it actually makes a lot of sense
as a method of reducing violent&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we imagine a different situation where an out-going king chose one of
their children on the basis of temperament and competency, this would
for many years introduce uncertainty about who the next king would be.
Uncertainty raises the potential power of factions as they angle behind
various contenders which in turn increases the probability of violence.
By introducing criteria for a ‘good king’ it would also make it more
likely that outsiders would try to make a case that they
better&amp;nbsp;fulfil&amp;nbsp;the criteria than any of the heirs on offer, which again,
increases the likelihood of violence. Always sticking with the
first-born means you don't have to judge on any other criteria, and the
order of&amp;nbsp;succession&amp;nbsp;will change as few times as possible[1. To bring
this back to male primogeniture, because swapping heirs from a girl to a
boy increases the number of order changes, on the face of it it's a bad
thing - but if the fundamental concern is stability and there's a
substantial faction that would back a male heir over a female heir
anyway, there's nothing to be gained by a system
that&amp;nbsp;legitimized&amp;nbsp;another potential faction.].&amp;nbsp;So looking at it this way
it isn’t about selecting the right ruler, it’s about establishing norms
that disqualify everyone else. Lots of people can raise an army but
almost no one is the first-born son of the king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this was going through my head about about the same time as I was
reading the &lt;em&gt;Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; books, which was convenient because
Martin spends an a lot of time dwelling on the problems of succession.
While the series is often quite &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/18/realpolitik_in_a_fantasy_world"&gt;politically
interesting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;what
I hadn’t noticed straight-off is how methodical he is at taking apart
and examining the problem of what makes a monarch legitimate - each of
the various Kings that end up fighting over the Iron Throne in &lt;em&gt;Game of
Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; are operating on different principles of
legitimation. Because Robert and Ned have overthrown Aeron the norms
governing succession have broken down and the stage is set for people
who would ordinarily be disqualified to make a play for the throne.
Given Joffrey is illegitimate, Stannis’ claim as the younger brother of
ex-King Robert is fairly straight-forward but there is no way for Renly
to trace a claim that doesn’t involve going through Stannis first.
Instead Renly bases his claim on a charismatic populism, not that he is
the rightful heir but that he would be a better and more popular king
than everyone else is on offer. Elsewhere Robb Stark is effectively
making the case for a right of national self-determination for the
North, Joffrey’s claim is mostly already being on the throne (there’s a
lot to be said for institutional inertia) and when the Greyjoys start
making trouble, they claim their lands by right of conquest - something
that lurks in the background of everyone else’s claims is their ability
to enforce them (the throne they’re competing over is literally made of
swords after all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that not all of these are incompatible (there’s no
particular reason why Renly’s populism needs to clash with Robb’s
national self-determination) but between them all they lack a common
denominator to settle the issue other than endless bloody war, that’s
exactly what happened. While saying primogeniture results in peace would
clearly be an overstatement, it definitely has its upside. It’s also
inherently unstable because of the original problem that, just as it
doesn’t have a mechanism for selecting the most fit king, it also
doesn’t have a method of weeding out unfit ones either - for each
generation debilitating mental illness is a roll of the dice, as is the
possibility that the new monarch might just be such an awful person that
they threaten the system. It’s not wonderful, but part of what makes
Westeros such a depressing place is that sometimes it might just be as
good as you're going to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-plan-to-take-charge-of-scottish-independence-vote-6260514.html"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &amp;quot;independence lite&amp;quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Kellner of YouGov has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/"&gt;good run
down&lt;/a&gt;
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html"&gt;they're leaving a space open for it to
return&lt;/a&gt;,
and ERS Scotland&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases"&gt;is advocating a different
form&lt;/a&gt; of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;independence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One answer would be that the&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &amp;nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&amp;nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&amp;nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;on if people would
prefer&amp;nbsp;independence&amp;nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&amp;nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&amp;nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: Would you like a change to the status quo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: Would you prefer&amp;nbsp;independence or devo-max?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&amp;nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&amp;nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&amp;nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;stitch-up in&amp;nbsp;Westminster).&amp;nbsp;This leaves either&amp;nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&amp;nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&amp;nbsp;simplest&amp;nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&amp;nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&amp;nbsp;Scottish&amp;nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.&lt;/p&gt;

apologised&lt;/a&gt;,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.&lt;strong&gt;(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university&lt;/strong&gt;.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&amp;nbsp;seems to suggest that &amp;quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&amp;quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&amp;nbsp;acquainted - as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html"&gt;Jeremy Duns
points
out&lt;/a&gt;,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&amp;nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &amp;nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.&lt;/p&gt;

site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which might be taking small liberties with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html"&gt;original
intent&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&amp;nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&amp;quot; Bell said. &amp;quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The one thing you can say about Moffat stories is that they are
bursting with ideas, sometimes they don’t mesh well (a problem I have
with the Library two-parter) but when it works the show is just alive
with creative energy. This week we had: many, many details of River
Song’s increasingly temporally confused backstory - the crew of the
Enterprise manning the T-1000 with polite and deadly robot jellyfish,
travelling through time, setting right what once went wrong with
horrible horrible torture - &amp;nbsp;a mysterious religious order devoted to
answering the final question and ending the universe - &amp;nbsp;extractor
fans! This had it all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.abyssandapex.com/200710-wikihistory.html"&gt;Everyone kills Hitler on their first
trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly the crew of the Justice Vehicle are pretty awful people. Most
stories about time travellers who try to kill Hitler give them a
motive of trying to prevent the wrongs of the past (and then learn
important lessons about knock-on effects), the ‘travel to the very
last moment of their life and torture them’ approach is more
respectful of the timeline but also more morally reprehensible. It
has no deterrent effect, in fact it’s vital no one knows about them
because telling people about it would effect the timeline - what it
comes down to is people in the far future judging your life according
to criteria you’re not aware of and punishing you in a way that’s
really only to the benefit of their bloodlust. Hitler I imagine we
can all agree belongs on the shit list, but if Churchill (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/not-his-finest-hour-the-dark-side-of-winston-churchill-2118317.html"&gt;not
universally a wonderful
person&lt;/a&gt;)
had a visitor to his deathbed people might be more split.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time travellers creating an afterlife because God let us down by not
existing is also dipped into briefly in the Baxter and Clarke novel
‘&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_of_Other_Days"&gt;The Light of Other
Days&lt;/a&gt;’,
where towards the end the perfection of time-traversing wormholes
allows the far future to download and recreate the brain at the
moment of death. Sufficiently advanced technology indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions that cause the universe to end have a good pedigree. While
the obvious association of an ultimate question given Adams’ Who
connection is to Hitchhikers, what this made me think more of more
are two classic short stories, Clarke’s ‘&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://downlode.org/Etext/nine_billion_names_of_god.html"&gt;The Nine Billion Names of
God&lt;/a&gt;’
and Asimov’s ‘&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html"&gt;The Last
Question&lt;/a&gt;’. In ‘The
Nine Billion’ a computer is built to systematically list all the
possible names of God in the belief that when this happens the
purpose of the universe will be fulfilled and it will promptly shut
up shop - the final question is answered and silence will fall
(coincidentally, the stars going out now qualifies as a recurring
thing in New Who). In ‘The Last Question’ successive generations from
the near-present to the heat-death ask a question of the increasingly
sophisticated machines they’ve created, a question that’s at first an
intellectual curiosity and then gradually the last and only relevant
question: “Can entropy be reversed?”. While interesting I don’t think
this is any use for plot guessing purposes, I’m just hoping for
something better than “Doctor Who?” (Although there would be
something very Adamish in an inter-temporal war and attempted
universe-cide resulting from a very badly misunderstood knock knock
joke.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Mels grows up alongside with her parents, Moffat seems to be
pushing the idea that effectively they did raise her anyway and so
this solves the problem of how the show can tonally have Amy and Rory
having adventures not related to getting their stolen child back. I’m
willing to accept this-ish,but clearly Rory and Amy would be better
parents to a child now then they would have been when they themselves
were children. Given Mels seems to have a slightly rocky life and
most of what they know about River’s later life is that she’s
imprisoned in the Stormcage (which really in terms of actually
keeping people in is almost as bad as Arkham), it’d be easy for them
to imagine that Melody would have had a much better life if they’d
properly had the chance to raise her. It's a bit of a serious downer
and I’m curious to see if the show has any further interest in
addressing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the Doctor just dressing to go out in style, or does the outfit
change signify like in ‘Flesh and Stone’ that there’s a bit of story
missing that might appear later on? As ever, there is insufficient
data for a meaningful answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Party &amp;lt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Party-Andrew-Rawnsley/dp/0670918512&amp;gt;`__&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and
in the period when Brown thought a Lib-Lab coalition was a possibility
there's this brief anecdote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'He felt his legacy could be a progressive coalition. Brown imagined
a final six months at Number 10 as the sort of benign, presidential
'father of the nation' figure he had often dreamed of being. Talking
to Tom Fletcher that evening, Brown said: &amp;quot;If we somehow pull this
off, you'll find I'll turn into President Bartlet.'&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Brown with his long-standing affinity for America would reach for
&lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a model for a national leader perhaps isn't that
surprising but the infulence of the show is a recurring presence in
British politics,&amp;nbsp;from rumours that George Osbourne was basing a No. 10
floor plan around the West Wing to a'West Wing plot' &amp;nbsp;leading to a
government defeat and, more recently,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jul/12/edmiliband-davidcameron"&gt;Ed Miliband's
advisors&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;ending
meetings declaring '&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8"&gt;Let Bartlet be
Bartlet&lt;/a&gt;'. Biblical
allusions might now past us by, but&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqgLr5A0-m0"&gt;everyone knows who Josh
is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tomcharris.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/a-british-west-wing-beyond-our-abilities/"&gt;Tom
Harris&lt;/a&gt;
takes the lack of a British West Wing with an optimistic and positive
portrayal of&amp;nbsp;politicians partly as a failure of the &amp;nbsp;nation's&amp;nbsp;appetite
(which he sees as being incapable of digesting a show that earnest if
the accents were closer to home), but also the&amp;nbsp;nation's writers - unable
to write politicians&amp;nbsp;as anything other than cynical or corrupt. I think
this oversells the case, British television may not have produced the
West Wing but American television only&amp;nbsp;barely&amp;nbsp;did, producing it just
once and common portrayals of&amp;nbsp;politicians&amp;nbsp;in the US often skew closer to
the cynical. Not to say there's nothing to the idea of national tastes
but I think that there are specific structural problems with crafting&amp;nbsp;a
positive show about the machinery of government that make it easier
to&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;in the US than the UK. A clue as to why is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/12/once-and-future-president.html"&gt;Abigail
Nussbaum's
take&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
the West Wing is essentially a show&amp;nbsp;about the royal court of a more
politically acceptable medieval monarchy. Interestingly she points out
one of the most obvious example of this interpretation is from the same
episode that Miliband's advisors are drawing from, &amp;quot;Let Bartlet be
Bartlet&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Leo turns to each of the staff as they recite &amp;quot;I serve at the
pleasure of &amp;nbsp;the President of the United States.&amp;quot; He isn't leading a
pep rally; he's reminding them of their oaths of fealty, and
reminding Bartlet, who is standing just outside the room, of the
courage and devotion of the men and women he commands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in this context it's quite clear why something with the tone of the
West Wing would be quite hard to achieve in the UK - while the US
political system sanitised the trappings of monarchy, the UK instead
moved power into different arenas. The characters in the West Wing are
all attempting to&amp;nbsp;implement&amp;nbsp;the agenda of one man while also trying to
shape that agenda - the show's universe revolves around the President
and his staff's loyalty to him. &amp;nbsp;While the British Prime Minister is
potentially more powerful, they are not the only one in the room who
matters, their power base &amp;nbsp;is only one among many. In the Parliamentary
system many of the key positions of government are staffed by MPs&amp;nbsp;with
their own electoral mandate and their own overlapping and shared (but
also unique) agendas. Prime Ministers live with the constant knowledge
that the party as much as the electorate will be the eventual decider of
their fate. If a British Bartlet had concealed their MS, their decision
to seek a second term would be likely to be far less of a personal
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict is the bread and butter of drama and while the
check-and-balance heavy US system is filled with potential external
opponents for the team (it's not a coincidence that there's a Republican
Congress for the entire run) meaning that while there are conflicts
within the team, they remain low key and amicable. For a UK government
with a majority there are few effectual external opponents - the primary
antagonisms are then within the party, within the government and within
the main cast.&amp;nbsp;The West Wing transplanted to the New Labour era would
have the PM with the ability to do pretty much anything he wanted,
unless it was blocked by the second-billed character, a long-term friend
turned antagonist. Bartlet's troubled relationship with his Vice
President is ultimately harmless because the Vice Presidency isn't
necessarily&amp;nbsp;powerful (it's not a surprise that Iannucci's US version
of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Thick Of It&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a314997/armando-iannuccis-veep-picked-up-by-hbo.html"&gt;is based around the
VP&lt;/a&gt;),
the nearest analogy would be if Bartlet and Leo were at each other's
throats - it would be very hard for for the West Wing to be an
optimistic show in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the institution of the Prime Minster is relatively flexible,
depending on the circumstances of their election and the style of the
leader (the Major era very different from Blair, very different to
Cameron, etc)&amp;nbsp;there's no&amp;nbsp;equivalent&amp;nbsp;to the status of the Presidency
(except, of course, the Monarchy). The positive feelings and
glorification of the&amp;nbsp;institution's&amp;nbsp;history as well as the status-quo
bias of the US policy process justifies a kind of mythic stasis - &amp;nbsp;big
projects of the staff like Sam's&amp;nbsp;Manhattan&amp;nbsp;project for beating cancer,
Josh and Toby's tax-deductible&amp;nbsp;tuition are ultimately stories&amp;nbsp;about&amp;nbsp;why
these things didn't happen.&amp;nbsp;There are battles, some of which are won and
some of which aren't, but the status quo of the West Wing mostly remains
the same - there have always been kings and knights on horses defending
the realm and there always will be, they will be fighting about gun
control, gay rights, religion in government, today and tomorrow, and
tomorrow and tomorrow. That the characters take sides in this eternal
conflict without scoring any lasting&amp;nbsp;successes&amp;nbsp;(this only really applies
to the Sorkin era, once he leaves they quickly bring peace to the Middle
East) is arguably realistic in the context of a&amp;nbsp;political&amp;nbsp;system where
paralysis is envisioned as a positive feature and so even failure can
glorify the system. The ability of a British government to achieve
change (and the expectation that they will which stigmatizes&amp;nbsp;failure)
combined with a lack of a long-term, static institution of the Prime
Minister would make it difficult for a British West Wing to find the
same amicable atmosphere where characters sit around and talk about
timeless&amp;nbsp;issues in a consequence-free way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While none of this completely rules out the possibility of a optimistic
and earnest show about British politics (I've been trying to get hold of
the 'Number 10' Radio 4 plays to see if they pull it off), it does make
it easier to understand why&amp;nbsp;The West Wing has only happened once in the
US and not at all in the UK.&amp;nbsp;The 'royal court' take on the West Wing
would actually suggest we've had several films in the previous decade
that had optimistic and positive portrayals of the British system, they
were just all about the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

going to call some things wrong, what's more concerning is that it tends
to do this in ways that are revealing of deeper problems. Immediately
after the attacks in Norway the commentariat's initial reaction was to
blame it on Islamic terrorism, which is understandable because it is
after all the sexiest kind of terrorism. That the information that the
majority of terrorist attacks in Europe are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/25/missing_the_real_warning_signs"&gt;committed by home grown
groups&lt;/a&gt;
is easily found on the internet is neither here nor there - as Charlie
Brooker &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jul/24/charlie-brooker-norway-mass-killings"&gt;put
it&lt;/a&gt;,
the media coverage was less experts than guessers and they &amp;quot;were
terrible, like toddlers hypothesising how a helicopter works.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news media is rarely humbled or apologetic when they get things
wrong but simply moves on to being wrong about something else, often in
the same story. The next step here is the assertion with little proof,
that Anders Breivik is insane. It might well turn out that he is, but in
the meantime not only does this reinforce the harmful stereotype
connecting mental health issues with violence, it's also a bit
convenient because irrational people can't be expected to be reacting to
incentives and so it absolves anyone else of responsibility in creating
an environment where he felt that terrorism was a good idea. It's not
clear to me that his actions are inherently irrational, it's very
apparently a politically motivated crime with the express purpose of a)
harming 'the enemy' and b) gaining him and his beliefs exposure. Given
the well-established pattern of how the world's media cover shootings, b
was at least was a slam dunk. The Norwegian court in closing the hearing
was operating under the strange principle that it shouldn't be a
complacent part of a mass murderer's pre-meditated promotion strategy,
something that media outlets have always had much more trouble doing.
His (I'm assuming pre-prepared) image plastered websites and newspapers
for days, the 24 news channels didn't stop for speculation and
examination of his motives, and the attack spurred a series of '&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/"&gt;He's
obviously an awful person, but he's not
wrong&lt;/a&gt;'
articles. It's not the start of the revolution he hoped for but as a
political act, it was far from inconsequential. Dismissing him as simply
a 'maniac' ignores the fact that the reaction of the media to massacres
like these actually acts as a powerful incentive to commit them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the blame game, insanity neatly helps those who
occupy relatively mainstream spaces in society and have spent years fear
mongering about Islam pending takeover of Europe to create a comfortable
distance between themselves and Breivik. I'm going to pick on Tim
Stanley's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100098575/whatever-liberal-commentators-say-the-tea-party-does-not-bear-responsibility-for-anders-breivik/"&gt;Telegraph
post&lt;/a&gt;
for being well ahead of the curve on this one. Despite Breivik obvious
political motivations (like, he wrote them down) Stanley insists that
these are the actions of a 'lone psychopath', and that any connection
between his actions and his claimed motivations are entirely
coincidental. His statement that &amp;quot;[t]he kind of person who can
systematically shoot and kill that many people is mentally ill or
possessed by demons&amp;quot; is helpful, because here 'mental illness' is
performing exactly the same role that blaming things on demons does, a
scapegoat that absolves us of responsibility[1. Stanley's attempt to
dismiss his strawman notion that 'the left' thinks 'the right' is
responsible for all anti-Islamic violence by equating it with the
absurdity of the idea that 'the left' must be responsible for all
anti-Christian violence is especially cruel given that many Christians
would consider themselves to be on the left, and just the other year
churchgoers in Tennessee were gunned down by a man with a hatred of
liberals &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/knoxville-church-shooters-manifesto"&gt;who
name-checked&lt;/a&gt;
several of the same people as Breivik. Also despite what he says links
between Tea&amp;nbsp;Party groups and white supremacists are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.naacp.org/pages/tea-party-report"&gt;alive and
credible&lt;/a&gt;.]. Somehow
these 'lone wolves' get the idea that the world would be a better place
without certain groups and while maybe they're just picking ideas out of
the aether, it is at least slightly possible that they are aided to
these positions by reading the rhetoric of the people they say they're
reading. While with the media platform issue there are at least clear
steps that could be taken to reduce the problem, I'm not exactly sure
what the solution is here. I do think there's some sort of moral duty
incumbent on people not to make their careers spreading xenophobia and
hate, but that's less because people might go out and shoot people and
more because it's a generally shit thing to do. Melanie Phillips'
response to finding two of her articles within his manifesto &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/25/norway-melanie-phillips-hits-back"&gt;is
revealing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;quot;The supposed beliefs of Norway massacre's perpetrator has got the
left in general wetting itself in delirium at this apparently
heaven-sent opportunity to take down those who fight for life,
liberty and western civilisation against those who would destroy
it.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have vague sympathy here because Philips isn't actively fermenting
armed revolution but to me safeguarding western civilisation is a cause
that's probably worth killing for. If you're telling people the stakes
are &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; high, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://flyingrodent.blogspot.com/2011/07/worlds-first-anti-jihadist-mass.html"&gt;can you really claim distance when people take you
seriously&lt;/a&gt;?
If having been repeatedly told by authority figures that your cause is
literally the defence of western civilisation, you find yourself unable
to effect the mainstream political process but know that you'll be given
a world-wide platform if you commit a horrific act, why wouldn't it be
rational to put your manifesto on the internet and go kill a bunch of
kids? If the idea of 'killing innocents so more can be saved' is
inherently crazy then there's a lot of foreign policy we need to
revisit, and if killing full stop is a sign of deranged mind it's in
even bigger trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point here is that you don't have to be crazy to be an extremist and
you don't have to be crazy to kill people, either might be immoral but
by themselves do not suggest anything about someone's sanity. It might
yet turn out that Breivik is insane (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/anders-breivik-is-insane-says-his-lawyer-2326232.html"&gt;his lawyer thinks he
is&lt;/a&gt;,
let's wait for the doctors) but should that happen it doesn't
retrospectively improve the current rhetoric any more than if the attack
had been carried out by al-Qaeda it would have made the initial coverage
any less terrible - it simply means that that particular guess was
correct and it's one rooted in prejudices and self-interest rather than
reality.&lt;/p&gt;

post&lt;/a&gt;
explored, my reading of the Browne report is that they found it's the
responsibility of the state to ensure a decent level of funding for
education but also that the government decision making process can't be
trusted to carry this out -&amp;nbsp;requiring&amp;nbsp;a system in which money is
compelled out of the government coffers as loans, with prices set
elsewhere. The Browne report redefines the role of the state so that
there is no splitting of the burden between public and private sources,
but the state simply&amp;nbsp;provides&amp;nbsp; the capital upfront to allow your future
private self to fund your education. In this way it changes government's
role from being the representation of the public interest to one where
it plays banker and is no longer required to make funding decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are exceptions to this in a few courses that are deemed to require
continued public funding. While the courses listed are discussed only in
terms of economic worth, keeping any idea of a cultural benefit firmly
out of range, what the report’s actually getting at here isn’t just
which courses are and aren’t economically required but mostly that these
are courses that are more expensive to run, and so require subsidies to
hide the true cost from students who might be put off. This amounts to
an acknowledgement of the fairly obvious reality that students will be
put off from one course as opposed to another on the basis of price
(even when the cost isn't paid upfront) and concludes that the
intimidation of higher fees for economically vital professions is
considered serious enough that intervention is required. But to play the
free-market position for a moment (and indeed use the language used
elsewhere in the report), surely if these professions are truly vital,
their future employers will pay higher wages that justify the investment
they make in an education? If student choice has failed us here, are
there other instances we should correct for the market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly this means the Browne report does have a notion of the
public good, but only in so far as we have enough engineers - there is
no such argument made, for instance, that there is a good in having our
elite institutions truly open to all. [1. I agree with Paul Sager that
if we’re looking at elite institutions as a way for the poor to leapfrog
into the higher echelons of society this &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2010/11/19/tuition-fees-social-justice-and-social-mobility/"&gt;isn’t the best conception of
the overall
problem&lt;/a&gt;,
but that said a system in which the existing elite completely dominate
the institutions that perpetuate it is even more undesirable than one in
which that’s only partly true.] &amp;nbsp;Browne at the same time as basing its
system around the idea of student (consumer) choice, keeps pulling back
from the idea that students are actually capable of making the correct
decisions – and to be honest they’re probably right to - it’s not at all
clear that even given ridiculous amounts of metrics prospective students
will be in any position to make educated choices, as laid out in Stefan
Collini’s &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble"&gt;excellent critique of
Browne&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Browne appears to believe that the only relevant measure of teaching
quality is ‘student satisfaction’. That is how the system will work:
if they are satisfied, they’ll pay, and if not, not; and the
pressure they exert thereby will ‘drive up quality’. But this, other
problems aside, comes perilously close to reducing important human
experiences to a set of ‘preferences’ as reported on a tick-box
questionnaire. I would hope the students I teach come away with
certain kinds of dissatisfaction (including with themselves: a
‘satisfied’ student is nigh-on ineducable), and it matters more that
they carry on wondering about the source of that dissatisfaction
than whether they ‘liked’ the course or not. This is another respect
in which the ‘consumer’ model is simply misleading, an error
encouraged by the prevalence in current edspeak of the category of
‘the student experience’ (many universities now have a senior figure
entitled Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Student Experience). It may be that
the most appropriate way to decide whether the atmosphere in the
student bar is right is by what students say when asked in a
questionnaire whether they ‘like’ it or not. But this is obviously
not the best way to decide whether a philosophy degree should have a
compulsory course on Kant. The philosophy department might hope
that, some time after graduation, most of its former students would
come to see the wisdom of this requirement, but ‘student
satisfaction’ is not what is at issue here. That this recognition is
retrospective tells us something important about education:
individuals often need to be told by someone who knows that a
particular line of study is worth pursuing whether at the time they
want to or not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the report writers attempted to solve the perceived inability of
politicians to make the right call on education by turning that decision
over to a market, it’s not at all clear that the mechanism they picked
is appropriate to the task and the report itself doesn’t have a great
deal of trust in prospective students to make the right decisions when
it’s really important. The vaguely tragic thing about the Browne report
is that the version that arrived in the final coalition plan doesn’t
even seem to achieve its own ends. Its goal of separating education
funding from government oversight has failed as the caps mean that many
universities will raise their fees to the cap just to replace cuts and
so future governments will be required to either raise the cap or
increase public investment in order to inject more money into the
system. I don’t think it’s a universally terrible plan, the repayment
plan is genuinely more progressive but it’s not at all convincing that
the fees based market approach gives enough benefits to justify the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/nov/18/ipsos-mori-poll-tuition-fees-cuts"&gt;discouraging
effects&lt;/a&gt;
that putting the price upfront &amp;nbsp;produces.&lt;/p&gt;

January, the recent (and completely predictable) announcements that
everyone who can get away with it will be charging the maximum spurred
me to go back and finish it off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Aaron Porter on the 10 o’clock the other week (note: now many,
many months ago) criticising fees and loans on the basis that it will
put students into debt for decades, which coming from the NUS position
of a graduate tax is a little unfair as there is no practical difference
between repaying a loan for three decades and being subject to an
additional tax for the same amount of time (especially if both the tax
and repayments are structured in a progressive way). If we imagine a
situation where universities charged an infinite fee, an infinite loan
was given and repayments were structured progressively and had a sunset
after a few decades, there is no difference whatsoever in the effect on
the payee. There is however a psychological difference between a debt
with an exact price attached and a fuzzy commitment to higher taxes
that’s given too short a shrift in the report. Given the choice, giving
people good news (free university!) with hidden bad news (new higher
tax!) is better than giving bad news with hidden good news (Expensive
university! &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14111421"&gt;Which you might not have to pay all
of!&lt;/a&gt; And the repayments
process is good! But the frogurt is also cursed etc) and efforts to
reassure people that university is actually pretty affordable have to
fight uphill against that basic gut reaction, no matter how nice the
numbers look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that problem you’d hope that fees-and-loans had some pretty
substantial advantages over a graduate tax, but the Report’s criticisms
of it are quite revealing of what it’s actually trying to do. There are
a few areas where fees-and-loans is cleaner than a graduate tax would be
e.g. a graduate tax has issues reclaiming money from graduates who move
abroad and in dealing with students who&amp;nbsp;didn't&amp;nbsp;complete their courses
(not deriving enough benefit from their courses to justify a tax but
still a drain on the education budget), but the big issue Browne finds
with it is that it’s economically&amp;nbsp;unfeasible&amp;nbsp;given that it won’t start
to produce enough money to fund itself until 2041. This nicely overlooks
that fees-and-loans also requires the government to borrow/spend a large
amount of money year on year to be able to give loans to students and
the average student won’t start come close to paying back the original
amount until around the same time period. &amp;nbsp;[update: &amp;nbsp;the difference here
is a quirk of government accounting where loans only need to be
accounted for at the rate of non-repayment (RAB rate) - the actual lost
money over the long term - whereas spending money resulting from a tax
requires the full education budget to fit on the government coffers].
&amp;nbsp;In both systems investment is not paid back for around 30 years – and
in the meantime the money still has to come from somewhere. I think what
the report’s criticism of a graduate tax is really getting at is the
notion that runs right through the report that government has
historically failed to make the investments necessary and cannot be
trusted to provide the general investment or per student funding the
system needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read it, the unwritten purpose throughout the report is to
safeguard university funding from future government action under the
(perhaps not unreasonable) assumption this government or likely future
governments will not substantially increase the amount of money going
into education through the block grant to universities, especially under
the current austerity plans. It takes the approach of rather than
arguing for increased public investment in further education, assume
that that’s a lost cause and try to find ways to do it without
government needing to be involved. By transforming all government
spending on further education into a guarantee of providing loans and
letting universities set the fees (with no caps) this gives universities
a semi-blank check from the government coffers to invest in themselves.
This I suspect is the serious objection of the Browne Report to a
graduate tax, despite shifting the cost onto graduates as a group it
leaves the funding decisions to government. With Fees-and-Loans that
year on year spending is hidden and occurs automatically behind the
loans, no actual decision is required to fund it. it’s hard to see any
government challenging the idea of deferred payment and it’s far easier
for fees-and-loans to hide behind this than a graduate tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the problem here is that giving universities a blank cheque is a
really bad idea because in the unlikely, “why would that ever happen?”
event that lots of universities change high fees (ironically as Stephen
Tall &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://iaindale.com/posts/why-the-coalition-is-muddled-but-right-about-tuition-fees"&gt;points
out&lt;/a&gt;,
this might not have happened without fee caps), the government is then
on the hook for more than it’s really able to be and we end up with the
situation where they’re desperately looking to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/node/18897863?story_id=18897863&amp;amp;fsrc=rss"&gt;offload some of the debt
load onto the private
sector&lt;/a&gt;.
As the next post will go into, at the same time as a market-based system
still runs into the money problem it’s also opened up a whole new can of
worms in terms of what a market in education is actually supposed to
function.&lt;/p&gt;

how through the internet we're seeing a form of activist emerge, looking
to change the world through fairly untraditional means. As some of the
most high profile and interesting examples, I'm going to look at
Wikileaks and Facebook.&amp;nbsp;My starting point is the idea that both of these
are projects that attempt to utilize the power of technology to create
social change without the need for a large consensus in favour of that
change. Assange is much easier than Zuckerberg to examine in this
respect because he's quite publicly explored and written down exactly
what he believes and intends to accomplish and Wikileaks is quite
clearly conceived of as a way to achieve these ends (whereas while
Facebook is underpinned by various philosophies, I suspect it wasn't
conceived of as a means to an end in quite the same way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Bady has a fantastic exploration of his
ideas&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
but as he says
Assange's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is
quite readable. His basic premise is that most governments and
organisations can be understood as conspiracies (with an explicit
parallel to how terrorist networks have been modelled) that will create
ways to communicate in secret. Having an environment where secrets can
be kept makes it more likely that things that need to keep secret will
occur (typically bad things) and so we want methods of destroying these
conspiracies. The traditional method of destroying important nodes (e.g.
assassination of key figures) is not always hugely effective if the
network can route round them (plus it's frowned upon in politic society)
so Assange focuses on how the links between conspirators can be
disrupted to erode and reduce the 'total conspiratorial power' of the
network. While that essay doesn't look at the idea of leaks
specifically, Wikileaks quite clearly fits neatly into that role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's helpful to look at this through a specific example, so let's think
about how 'cablegate' fits in. It's a nice point of irony the reason why
this leak was possible at all was the realisation in the US intelligence
community of the issue that more secure communication is not always the
most effective communication, one of the conclusion that came out of the
9/11 commission was that a fair amount of useful information existed but
was being kept in closed silos by various different agencies and that a
system that sharing information needed to be used more. This led
to&amp;nbsp;massive expansion in the use of SIPRNet to the point it's now
accessible in a large amount of embassies and US military bases, and
while we can't say how many people have physical access to the system in
1993 at least&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/28/siprnet-america-stores-secret-cables"&gt;three
million&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;had
the 'secret' clearance that would have given them the right to view it
and there's no particular reason to think that's decreased by a huge
degree ( for scale, that's around 1% of the current US population). The
electronic nature means that it's possible to steal what would once have
been a warehouse of data out in something that fits in your pocket and
while there are also safeguards in place to detect and prevent people
doing exactly what Manning is accused of doing, there are suggestions
that this was turned off as it was inconvenient for people using the
system (The problem in microcosm: greater secrecy again getting in the
way of an efficient system.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting bit of Assange's thinking is not the familiar trade-off
between convenience/openness and secrecy/security but how he intends to
use that to get the conspiracy to destroy itself. He argues that a
conspiracy that's communication is compromised will lock down further,
reducing its own ability to organise and conspire that will ultimately
lead to it either losing the ability to function at all or reduce its
ability to fight off outside threats. As Bady put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Instead, he is trying to strangle the links that make the conspiracy
possible, to expose the necessary porousness of the American state's
conspiratorial network in hopes that the security state will then
try to shrink its computational network in response, thereby making
itself dumber and slower and smaller.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This endgame and the focus on making the links between conspirators
untrusted explains why these leaks are of a different character to how
we'd normally expect leaks to look. Typically leaks are things
considered by the leaker to be evidence of crimes, bad practice, etc but
in this case while there have been a few juicy tidbits the vast majority
of the leaks are quite boring because for this strategy the content of
the leaks is almost unimportant as it's their very existence that
reduces the trust of the conspirators and makes them turn on the
system[2. The other side of this is that releasing boring information
shows how much information is pointlessly marked secret and can be seen
as part of the argument in favour of more open government, all of us
linked to all of us has greater ‘computational power’ in Assange’s
language and releasing information more freely increases the prospects
of it being combined with other useful information to result better
analysis of that information. This is a view of government openness
framed in terms of efficiency rather than public interest that can be
picked up in a lot in techie discussion on the subject and I might see
if I can explore further in a future post.].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we can probably expect to see the network close down, by
enforcing the security procedures that already exist or having better
division of access so that people on military bases in Iraq don't have
access to the entire sum of secret knowledge but the interesting
question is if the diplomats will trust any such system or if in future
they'll be more guarded in what they write and just rely on informal
communication for anything they don't want to write down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reliance on informal methods will indeed make it dumber, slower and
less able to function – but will it shut down altogether? I suspect not,
the modern state can survive an enormous amount of inefficiency
and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/11/22/the_us_is_too_secure_for_its_own_good"&gt;Stephen Walt's
argument&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that
through America's overwhelming global dominance its decision making
processes are insulated from even large screw-ups applies here. US
global hegemony and its state's secrecy culture can survive a lesser
functioning diplomatic corp. and there are no real existential threats
on the institution. The 'convince the snake to eat itself' strategy can
only be effective in organisations where there is very small difference
between 'status quo' and 'complete institutional collapse', which I
don't think is the case in a lot of these organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see other examples of this in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338038"&gt;'postit'
culture&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it's been suggested has
risen within the British government after FOI came in, where rather than
leave controversial details in documents that may someday be subject to
FOI request (and even ones that won't) these are attached as post-it
notes to the documents, which can safely be discarded at the other end.
Less efficient maybe and terrible for future historians, but it is
unlikely to lead to internal collapse or leave it much more vulnerable
to outside threats. The institution is secure. Fundamentally Wikileaks
represents an attempt to create an institution that in turn creates
institutional change in other organisations. It doesn't seek to directly
destroy secretive norms of behaviour, it seeks to turn them in on
themselves and my thinking is that this will ultimately prove
ineffective as there are many lower levels of function the conspiracy
will be willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to starting point what I'm trying to get at is that the
internet allows powerful institutions to exist without requiring much in
the way of social support. One man with a Lady Gaga CD can download the
entire backlog of diplomatic cables, and another group can deliver the
largest leak in history to the world. In terms of sheer power, the
internet is a great leveller but what Assange (and as we'll get to,
Zuckerberg) want is norm changes. Wikileaks has the power to disrupt
conspiracies directly by leaking damaging information on them but what
he really wants to able to do is remove the ability to conspire and
prevent future potential conspirators even wanting to – and I think this
a goal I'm&amp;nbsp;skeptical&amp;nbsp;can be accomplished in all cases through the clash
he describes and requires a view on how institutions can be reformed to
openness.&lt;/p&gt;
