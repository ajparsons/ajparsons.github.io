					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/libdems/4519924649/"><img alt="Election 2010 Day 9 - Nick Clegg &amp; Vince Cable Launch the 2010 Liberal Democrat Manifesto" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4007/4519924649_86f3dc20ee_n.jpg" /></a>In the Lords report on the Lords Reform Bill
there's some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#a60">interesting
discussion</a>
of if a referendum is required or&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;before reform can proceed.</p>
<p>Alongside the standard argument that major constitutional change should
require a referendum is the idea that as all three major parties entered
into the last election with a manifesto commitment&nbsp;to Lords reform, no
party has a mandate to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;Lords reform. This is on the face of
it, puzzling - if a policy is so popular that all parties feel
it&nbsp;advantageous&nbsp;to put in their&nbsp;manifesto how can whatever government
results not have a mandate as a result? Here's what was said (or
summarized at the end if you want to skip):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="373">
<li>...The Government's view is that:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;because all three parties were in favour of this, we did not think
that a referendum was justified. When the House of Lords
Constitution Committee looked at referendums, it said that it
thought that abolition of the House of Lords would be a subject on
which you would automatically want to have a referendum, but it did
not say that changing the composition of the House of Lords would be
such a proposition. So, no, we do not think that a referendum is
necessary, and that is why we did not propose it in our draft Bill
or White
Paper&quot;.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note438">438</a>]</p>
<p>373. Despite the constitutional importance of the subject, the lack
of a clear party division on the issue means that any opposition to
the proposed reform cannot readily be tested at any future election
by voting for one or other candidates seeking election to the House
of Commons. If the Government has its way, the draft Bill will have
become an Act before the next general election, at which the first
tranche of elected Members of a reformed House of Lords would be
seeking election. There is thus no opportunity for the electorate to
provide a mandate for these
proposals.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note439">439</a>]</p>
<p>374. Mr Christopher Hartigan, who described himself as &quot;a member of
the public with an interest in constitutional matters and Lords
Reform in particular&quot; put it:</p>
<p>The fact that elections were mentioned in the three manifestoes does
not mean it is the settled view of a party, it is not, or the
majority of members of a party agree with it or that the electorate
want it either. It can be said that the fact that it was in three
manifestos makes it clear that the people had no choice. It should
also be remembered all three parties LOST the election. ... If the
government believe this is the will of the people then it should
proceed on a free vote of their representatives or hold a
constitutional referendum before such important changes are made.</p>
<p>377. Professor Vernon Bogdanor told us in oral evidence that a
referendum would be the right way forward because all three parties
proposed an elected Lords in their election manifestos in 2010, so
there was no way for the voter to indicate his or her opinion: &quot;I
think it would be right to hold a referendum on this issue, which I
think is a greater change than the alternative vote system that has
been rejected&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substantial argument here is that&nbsp;politically popular is not the
same as popularly popular, the policy&nbsp;could in fact be a stitch-up among
the political class to deny choice on a certain issue while
the&nbsp;truly&nbsp;popular policy goes unexpressed.&nbsp;The point about mandates is
that they result from the public having made a set of choices of Party A
over Party B, if there was no&nbsp;differentiation, there was no choice to be
made, thus no mandate.</p>
<p>This makes the maths of mandates somewhat counter-intuitive. If we
imagine rival parties A and B and the mandate for policy X, we end up
with this strange table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>Party A</strong></td>
<td><strong>Party B</strong></td>
<td><strong>Mandate</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>A has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Y</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If no party is in support, there is no mandate for X, if every party is
in support, there is no mandate for X.&nbsp;If we take the idea of mandates
seriously for a minute this means if&nbsp;the other side steals your good
idea, then suddenly they've taken away your mandate to implement it.
Does that mean that policy X should be put to a referendum to gain its
mandate? Or if arguing that that's reserved for constitutional issues
(which X may not be),&nbsp;does it mean the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention">Salisbury
doctrine</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2011/07/04/salisbury-lords-reform-history/">if it
still
exists</a>)
shouldn't apply because X doesn't really have a mandate from the nation?</p>
<p>Added to that is a question of how different policies X and Y need to be
before the public can be said to have offered&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;choice. While
all three&nbsp;manifestos pledged to reform the House of Lords, Labour
differed in requiring a referendum, the Conservatives only committed to
a 'mainly-elected' chamber - are those differentiation enough that
voters had a choice?&nbsp;Labour wanted open-list PR, if the Lib Dems had put
their preference for STV into the manifesto would that have been making
a choice?</p>
<p>In this case the argument is limited to saying that an issue that would
otherwise require a referendum can go without if the election was fought
out on a very specific set of circumstances, but the general principle
is worth thinking about&nbsp;as&nbsp;there are any number of areas where overlap
between the parties is large. &nbsp;The argument is that certain manifesto
combinations shouldn't be given practical&nbsp;significance, but the
fiddlyness of the situation that results seems to argue pretty well that
manifesto&nbsp;commitments&nbsp;shouldn't have practical&nbsp;significance full stop.</p>
<p>This ultimately comes down to the old question of what exactly happens
in an election - are we empowering people to decide or people to
deliver? At various times manifestos were certainly viewed as binding -
Stanley Baldwin claimed the 1923 election was held solely to reverse a
manifesto&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;of his&nbsp;predecessor[1. Dennis Kavangh, '<a class="reference external" href="http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIV/1/7.extract">The
Politics of
Manifestos</a>',&nbsp;Parliamentary&nbsp;Affairs,
34(1),1981 ,p.8] - but Kavanagh argues that this becomes
increasingly&nbsp;untenable&nbsp;in the modern age:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead of the mandate referring to a major issue, governments now
use the term to justify a battery of items in the manifesto, however
picayune they may be. As pledges are fulfilled, so the government
spokesman claims that he has kept faith with the electorate,
regardless of the popularity of the measure. But it is the sheer
number of proposals in modern manifestos which weakens the notion of
the mandate as the conscious support of each manifesto proposal by a
person who votes for the party. It is because voters for a party
simply cannot be expected to be aware of all of the proposals, let
alone agree with them, that Finer makes the charge of &quot;manifesto
moonshine &quot; [2. Ibid. p. 9]</blockquote>
<p>This raises the obvious&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;about the idea of mandates: when
voters enter the voting booth are they really endorsing the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of
that party's manifesto? Might their decision perhaps be&nbsp;influenced&nbsp;by
other considerations? Can a party really claim a mandate from the nation
for a vague&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;hidden in a footnote on page five underneath the
'beware of the leopard' sign?</p>
<p>I think it'd be fair to say that today (ignoring fiddly issues such as
the position of coalition agreements) while 'mandate' is thrown around
as a useful bit of&nbsp;language, the predominate mindset is that
governments&nbsp;can do anything they can practically achieve and
that&nbsp;manifestos only have practical, as opposed to political,
significant in odd (and probably doomed) cases like the Salisbury
doctrine - on the basis of the above it's hard to say there's much wrong
with this.</p>
<p>I remain a bit unsure if the&nbsp;cancelling&nbsp;maths of mandates is something
that should be taken seriously but given both accepting it and rejecting
it stress the idea of manifesto mandates to breaking point it does
illustrate the underlying concept is a bit fragile and shouldn't be too
heavily relied on.&nbsp;For Lords reform,&nbsp;this means that if a referendum is
needed (and I think would be the last chance for groups like Unlock
Democracy to establish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/the-public-should-have-the-power-to-veto-elected-lords-not-another-vanity-r">an alternative
principle</a>),
a referendum is needed - and that in general we should shy away from
arrangements that give much practical importance to manifesto promises
(while of course being free to politically punish parties for breaking
them).</p>

                </h2>
				Jun 21, 2012
                
				
					<p>The goal with this post was to see if I&nbsp;could come up in a morning with
a quick method to test the 'politicalness' of eurovision voting. &nbsp;To
keep it simple I assumed that most 'political' voting was related to
cultural factors that would map onto geographical proximity and so the
question became 'Would countries give higher points to countries closer
to them than those further away'?&nbsp;Using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/Eurovision2010">this
dataset</a> of all results from
1998-2009 and the results from the Wikipedia pages for
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010">2010</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011">2011</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012">2012</a>, I
created a single dataset of all votes cast since 1998. Then I made a
list for each eurovision country of all other eurovision countries they
shared a border with. For countries bordering seas, I counted all
countries with reasonable straight lines across the water (erring on the
side of being over generous). From this I created a new variable
representing the degrees of separation between the source and
destination of all votes (where 1 means they share a border, 2 means
there’s one country in the middle and so on). This dataset is
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjeRO7qR270JdFhxSHU3ZVBNSG1MTXQ5aHZhZkhZamc#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>A robust regression shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship at the 1% level where each less degree of separation
between A and B increases the number of points transferred from A to B
by 0.39(±0.068). The exact coefficient varies year on year and the
relationship drops from significance in 1998 and 2001. As the first few
‘hops’ are likely to be the most important (it’s doubtful the hop from 4
to 5 degrees of separation is a serious consideration for anyone), it’s
worth re-running the regression looking only at if countries share a
border or not. From this we get another significant relationship where a
country will give around 1.9(±0.245) more points to countries it shares
a border with than those it won’t.</p>
<p>While it's nice to have a number on this we’re only explaining a few
percent of the overall vote transfer (2.6% when using all degrees
of&nbsp;separation&nbsp;and 4.6% when only using border/noborder) and it’s not at
all clear that ‘degrees of separation' &nbsp;are the best measurement of
geographic effects. Would the effect be larger or smaller if I was less
generous with borders over seas? Should we be looking at ‘regions’,
countries that share a language? This analysis used all votes cast, but
not all countries are regular players - the relationship might be
different if it was cut down to those who vote every time.</p>
<p>At this point rather than plough on, &nbsp;I decided to look up if anyone had
ever done any proper work on&nbsp;eurovision and found that of course they
have and a great common thread in these is some kind of justification
for having bothered to study something like Eurovision in the first
place.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>
is arguing Eurovision can be used to create a cultural structural
analysis of the post iron-curtain Europe and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn et
al</a> that the
&quot;Eurovision&nbsp;network&nbsp;is analogous to a range of other complex dynamic
networks involving&nbsp;the&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;of goods and opinions&quot;...which are
clearly just excuses.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn, Suleman, Efstathiou and
Johnson</a> (2006) looked at
Eurovision as a network in terms of &nbsp;how in sync countries are with each
other i.e. how similarly are their votes distributed when you ignore
their votes towards each other. They found that the UK was actually the
most 'in sync' with&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;in general between 1992 and 2003 and while
there were patterns that vindicated my geographical links such&nbsp;Estonia
being associated with the Nordic countries, others raise serious
problems with it such as Spain being absent from the group that includes
France and&nbsp;Portugal.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>(1995
- so an older study of a very different eurovision) similarly look at
network effects breaks down eurovision countries into &quot;five meaningful
cliques&quot;, which are further combined into Western, Northern and
Mediterranean blocs (where the last feels like a 'and the rest' bloc)
and that the then supremacy of countries in the Western Bloc was a
result of three of the most&nbsp;strongly&nbsp;knit cliques are located within it.
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=884379">Ginsburgh and
Noury</a>(2004)
is the closest to a more developed version of my attempt, looking at the
effect of cultural and linguistic proximity (which geographic proximity
would at best be acting as a proxy for) on points and finding that a)
these are important factors that far exceed the effects of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> and b) that the
'quality' of the song tends to have quite a large effect on the results.</p>
<p>So in a most boring answer, Eurovision turns out to be actually about
the music. But that's the numbers for you.</p>

				Feb 03, 2012
                
				
					<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EYhVwPqCQ">this video</a>
emerged on the Internet of Boris Johnson being chased outside City Hall
by a man in a chicken suit:</p>
<p>As it turns out this chicken isn't even chasing the actual Boris, giving
us a man wearing a chicken suit chasing a man dressed a man with a fake
blonde wig, being&nbsp;filmed with a shaky camera for authenticity. It's a
strange world we live in, but stranger still is that following
politicians while wearing chicken-suits has a long and proud&nbsp;history.
&nbsp;As far as I can tell, it started in America when Gerald Ford <a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/120064/tales-of-a-serial-prankster-interviewing-the-president-while-wearing-a-chicken-suit/">addressed
the chicken
mascot</a>
of a local radio station while on campaign - a New York Times reporter
then promptly bought the costume off the station and showed up to a
press event in it as a prank (<a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/22347153">video
here</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/chicken-300x173.png:target:/uploads/chicken.png" /></p>
<p>The chicken then went dormant for a while, reappearing in 1992 <a class="reference external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5NGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4586,977613">working
for
Clinton</a>&nbsp;(great
illustration in that article) as 'Chicken George', but this time around
the chicken had a political objective. The job of this chicken was hound
George H. W. Bush for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/news/01iht-deba.html">stonewalling debate
negotiations</a>&nbsp;and
this has been a recurring use of chicken suits since. This version of
the chicken I'm assuming is the inspiration for events in&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/sixth/615fredonia.html">season six
of the West
Wing</a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;Josh
Lyman similarly deploys&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;in chicken suits to hound opponents
who wouldn't debate his candidate.</p>
<p>The Chicken crossed the Atlantic for the 1997 election, giving us the
'Tory Chicken', who followed Tony Blair to highlight that he had
declined to debate John Major. For some reason this triggered a
previously unknown British capacity for animal-suit politics, spawning a
fox to chase the chicken off and a rhinoceros&nbsp;opposed to the idea of
animal suits entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chicken was to follow the Labour leader, who was campaigning in
the marginal Tory seat held by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary. However, his efforts to henpeck Mr Blair were hampered by
a man from the Scottish Daily Mirror dressed as Freddy the Fox, who
blocked his path during a 15-minute walkabout.</p>
<p>As Mr Blair approached, the chicken was seen to stumble and was
pushed to the back of the crowd surrounding the Labour leader, where
it waved a placard before skulking off. A jubilant Freddy observed:
&quot;I had him for dinner. I stopped him getting anywhere near Tony.
Tony shook my hand and thanked me for it.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Mr Blair's guardian refused to identify himself, saying:
&quot;The whole thing is embarrassing enough as it is.&quot; The incident came
at the end of a traumatic day for the Tory chicken. Earlier, he got
into a nasty fight with a rival chicken with a detachable head, sent
by the Mirror newspaper, as he strutted across College Green in
Westminster. He was also pursued across London by another fox, two
teddy bears and a plastic rhinoceros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/rantext/random-politics/the-tory-chicken-loses-its-head">That whole

is worth a read if only for the full description of the Chicken's fight

<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.canoe.ca/raisinghell/general/doer-smarter-than-your-average-chicken/">Canadian&nbsp;provincial&nbsp;elections</a>
so there's a fair chance&nbsp;I've missed several chicken sightings but the
idea of using chickens to draw attention to lack of debates (and assign
blame) seem to be a recurring thing here. Given this back story, what do
we make of this latest chicken? &nbsp;That the real Boris doesn't even appear
in Ken's chicken's videos so far (and that it's not explained in video
why there's a chicken) is interesting as the chicken&nbsp;usually&nbsp;tries to
muscle in on it's target's event and steal the focus.&nbsp;Is chasing fake
Boris a sign of laziness or a sign that the media landscape is changing
and our use of chicken suits with it? &nbsp;Do&nbsp;we now understanding a chicken
suit as short-hand for dodging debates? Or does the lack of context of
the clip&nbsp;reflect the changing face of media, that it's now better to get
a short and intriguing video on the internet and draw people to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.borisjohnshen.com/">your
site</a> than to try and worm in at your
opponent's own media events?</p>
<p>For entirely unrelated reasons, <a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/203347/voting-in-nevada-dont-wear-a-chicken-suit">you can't vote in a chicken-suit in
Nevada</a>.</p>
