					<p>I've reached the point in my suicide contagion project where new
research is starting to fit very nicely into the final framework (which
hopefully suggests I'm onto something, or alternatively that I've&nbsp;become
blind to contrary information - either/or). Today I read some new
research by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/279630540_Crisis_Phones__Suicide_Prevention_Versus_SuggestionContagion_Effects">Stack
(2015)</a>
on if crisis phones on bridges were an effective means of suicide
prevention.</p>
<p>What he found was a little unsettling.&nbsp;We know people use them (good!)
and that these people tend not to&nbsp;jump (also good!) but did suicides on
the bridge increase or decrease after their installation? They&nbsp;rose. Ah,
but did the population increase? No. Did the local suicide rate increase
as well? No it went down. Ah.</p>
<p>Stack draws attention to a blog that covers bridge suicides (as well as
media coverage) that may be responsible in part for people choosing
bridge suicide over another method. But he also notes&nbsp;(if we believe
that 'suggestion' has influence on suicide) we should look carefully at
those&nbsp;phones:</p>
<blockquote>
The suggestion thesis holds that the phones, which were installed
with signs alerting suicidal people that they offer a link to help,
will suggest suicide to vulnerable persons. These at-risk
individuals may otherwise not have thought of suicide off the bridge
(Beautrais, 2007; Glatt, 1987). The suggestion hypothesis assumes
that such signs will affect only vulnerable persons at risk of
suicide. It is unlikely that they would impact healthy person.</blockquote>
<p>This last point is important - given we generally hold that
at-risk&nbsp;people can be negatively affected by messaging we should
consider this even when intentions are good. &nbsp;Research on other public
health interventions show we cannot rule out that things done in good
faith to save lives will end up doing net harm.</p>
<p>Klimes-Dougan and Lee (2010) did a study on if suicide prevention
billboards were effective - finding negative as well as positive
effects.&nbsp;They found their&nbsp;billboard (&quot;Prevent Suicide, Treat Depression
– See your Doctor&quot;&nbsp;) was in general good at getting people to believe
that treating depression was a good way to reduce suicide - but also
that their high-risk group tended to end up with a stronger perceived
link between depression and suicide after viewing a billboard. The worry
here is that being too explicit about the connection to depressed people
encourages a railroading of their future down that path. Their TV ad&nbsp;by
contrast didn't have that effect - it&nbsp;used the phrase &quot;it can even lead
to suicide&quot; as an escalation of symptoms of depression, making death one
of several possible options.</p>
<p>The billboard group also ended up with lower help-seeking scores than
the no-information group (A TV advert did better however, public health
campaigns not completely doomed) - directly encouraging people to seek
help might not have the results you hope&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>The lesson here is that&nbsp;this is tricky stuff - the words you use
matter.&nbsp;A workshop on public messages for suicide prevention made the
point that broad campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
Broad-based campaigns that are likely to reach multiple audiences
should determine how subgroups of intended populations (or
nontargeted&nbsp;groups of a population) might have different attitudes
about suicide, and may respond differently to messages geared
towards increasing help-seeking behavior (Cauce&nbsp;et al. 2002).</blockquote>
<p>But also that targeted campaigns might be bad:</p>
<blockquote>
For example, certain American Indian nations have very high rates of
suicide. A campaign via popular Indian radio stations that
highlights the high prevalence may inadvertently normalize suicide
and send the message that such behaviour is expected and is
inevitable. Groups with high rates may get the message that they
have experienced an expected behaviour, and the groups with lower
rates are simply &quot;lagging behind&quot; on what is seen to be inevitable.</blockquote>
<p>You might say they're just being risk adverse - but we have to
acknowledge that letting words loose into the world with the aim of
saving lives is something we seem to know little about. As Beautrais,
Fergusson, Coogan et al (2007) put it:</p>
<blockquote>
Until there is clear evidence that public health messages about
suicide prevent, and do not normalize, suicide, and have no
deleterious effects, the most prudent approach to this issue is not
to include&nbsp;public health messages as part of a suicide prevention
strategy.</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to print crisis lines after newspaper articles in suicide
- which are pretty clearly public health messages that are advocated
frequently&nbsp;as part of a suicide prevention strategy. &nbsp; Stack brings up
Niederkrontenthaler et al (2010) who found that newspaper stories that
printed the phone number of a crisis link seemed associated with an
increase in suicide rates. Now for the&nbsp;record, the authors were more
sceptical of this result than some of their others (they were checking
for so many things and it was one of their least significant results -
although still p &lt; 0.05) - but I can't find anyone else who has
suggested anything to the contrary.&nbsp;Others have done research on if
suicide lines are effective on those they reach e.g Gould et al (2007)
(answer: yes-ish - reduction&nbsp;in pain and hopelessness, but not an
apparent&nbsp;reduction in intent to die), there seems to be very little work
on if the advertisement of the lines is a good idea.</p>
<p>The problem here is the population who is exposed to the advertisement
but who will not be exposed to any&nbsp;positive effect of the helpline - if
this group contains at-risk individuals (which it does) then there is
the prospect of harm.&nbsp;That printing a suicide number could be
negative&nbsp;is consistent with research that billboards can have a harmful
effect and the idea that&nbsp;crisis phones on bridges&nbsp;might not be
universally fantastic.</p>
<p>That certain wordings of these crisis line adverts might be worse than
others is consistent with the idea that suicide contagion is more
powerful when people can identify (and have similarities) with the
subject of the article. If the wording asks you if you identify&nbsp;(&quot;If
you're affected...&quot; - &quot;ooh, am I?&quot;) it might create or intensify a
one-to-one relationship with the subject of the article upon
introspection. This suggests that they shouldn't be viewed as a
corrective or an addendum to the article but part of the text and so
part of any journey of identification.</p>
<p>There clearly isn't enough evidence to say this is something
papers&nbsp;should stop doing - but I think it's something we need to think
more carefully about.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it worrying I can create a hypothesis
based on the same theoretical framework the rest of contagion works on
-&nbsp;and that's consistent with the evidence we do have - that says we are
possibly making things worse. &nbsp;Even if we take&nbsp;Niederkrontenthaler et
al.'s scepticism seriously and move their result to the 'not proven'
column it is deeply concerning that we have almost no&nbsp;positive evidence
we can point to and say &quot;printing the phone number makes the suicide
rate go down&quot;&nbsp;. The idea&nbsp;that the message can never have a negative
effect on non-callers needs to have more thought put into it to justify
the pre-eminence of this advice.</p>
<p>Stack's main point is that crisis phones are not a good substitute for
barriers on bridges (just much cheaper). It's not clear what a more
effective alternative to crisis line ads following suicide stories would
be. I find the fact that most people who suffer from suicidal thoughts
end up not taking their own life a reassuring idea&nbsp;- a disclaimer built
around this idea encourages identification with the living rather than
the dead (and creates a universe larger than the reader and the subject)
could be an approach to explore. But there's no evidence on if this
would be a good approach&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>The final section of my project will deal more generally with how little
evidence there is for a lot of suggested interventions - but I wanted to
share a glimpse into just how much of an unknown doing anything
'positive' in this area can be.</p>
