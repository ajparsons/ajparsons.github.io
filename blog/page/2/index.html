					<p>Notes on Craig Lambert's 'Shadow Work: The Unpaid, Unseen Jobs That Fill
Your Day'. Short: just read the article version - doesn't gain much from
book length.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Lambert's:</p>
<blockquote>
I ADAPTED THIS term from the 1981 book Shadow Work by Austrian
philosopher and social critic Ivan Illich. For Illich, shadow work
included all the unpaid labor done in a wage-based economy, such as
housework. In a subsistence economy, work directly answers the needs
of life: gathering food, growing crops, building shelters, tending
fires. But once money and wages come into play, we encounter a whole
range of tasks that do not address our basic needs. Instead, such
jobs enable us to earn money to buy necessities and, if possible,
luxuries. That is paid work, not our subject here. This book will
identify and describe the unpaid jobs (like commuting) that an
industrial economy spins off for its citizens. Such jobs go
unnoticed because they take place in the wings of the theater while
we are absorbed in the onstage drama of our lives. They exist in the
shadows. Yet they are every bit as real as anything in the
spotlight.</blockquote>
<p>'Adapted' is probably the right word - the critique of self-help is a
bit more fierce in in Illich's original. Illich's definition of shadow
work:</p>
<blockquote>
I call this compliment to wage labour 'shadow work'. It comprises
most housework women do in their homes and apartments, the
activities&nbsp;connected with shopping, most of the homework of students
cramming for exams, the toil&nbsp;expended commuting to and from the job.
It includes the stress of forced consumption, the tedious and
regimented surrender to therapists, compliance&nbsp;with bureaucrats, the
preparation for work to which one is compelled, and many of&nbsp;the
activities usually labelled 'family life'. (p 100)</blockquote>
<p><strong>The false virtue of self-reliance</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Yet, unquestionably, it gives us more to do. Minor tasks like
returning our supermarket shopping carts to a holding pen or busing
our own Starbucks tables have become routine. “Why am I doing this?”
asked Daniel, a philosophy professor in western Massachusetts,
wheeling his empty shopping cart to the collection area. “What
happened to those teenagers who used to collect these things? I kind
of liked watching them push about twenty carts, all nested together,
across the parking lot.”</blockquote>
<p>A sign a few pages in that I'm not necessarily on the same wavelength.
Almost the idea here that tidying up after yourself &nbsp;(and this being
framed as a virtue) is a con so companies don't have to pay people to
clean up after you (and selfish of you because you're denying them
jobs). Possible I'm just socialised into finding that odd but
mechanically, it's only a short jump to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window">broken window
fallacy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Social Mobility</strong></p>
<blockquote>
If these bankers had gone out on hundreds of mortgage appraisals
like my dad did, seeing the actual houses for which they were
lending money and meeting real, live borrowers, would the 2008
banking crisis have happened?</blockquote>
<p>Probably? I think it's hard to argue that&nbsp;<em>no</em> bad decisions were ever
made&nbsp;before people put their own trolleys away?</p>
<blockquote>
But how does an aspiring banker work his way up from the teller’s
window if ATMs and shadow-working customers have displaced tellers?
How does a secretary become the office manager and later an
executive if shadow work eliminates support staff— so there are no
secretaries?</blockquote>
<p>Here we get to interesting questions about social mobility. I'll come
back to this.</p>
<blockquote>
For those without education and skills, these low-level positions
often are their careers. If such jobs vanish, a throng of unemployed
young people will find themselves with little money and too much
spare time. This is a dangerous development in any society. Unrest
and violence throughout the Arab world have erupted from streets
teeming with young men lacking jobs— angry youths who congregate
online through social media. Such mobs can become unruly. In 2003,
the dissolution of the Iraqi army put 400,000 young men out of work
, triggering a bloody insurgency that still continues. In today’s
global village, where citizens network and congregate in political
flashmobs, we cannot risk creating an immense underclass of idle
youth.</blockquote>
<p>De-Ba'athification and self-checkouts seem like extreme companions. Is
the issue of this situation no means of support (money can be exchanged
for goods and services) or spare&nbsp;time (Victorians standardise football
to attempt to control spare&nbsp;time, mixed results)? One&nbsp;is better to
intervene in than the other. Are there better solutions than just
maintain rubbish jobs?</p>
<p><strong>House Work</strong></p>
<p>Illich argues that this unpaid work is a necessary shadow component to
allow wage labour to exist at all and comes back to the unpaid work of
women again and again - &quot;The amount of shadow work laid on a person
today is a much better measure of discrimination than&nbsp;bias on the job&quot;(p
101). &nbsp;Lambert takes this to an extent, discussing medical students
where female doctors in training were found to spend far more time
performing household duties compared to their male counterparts but
pulls back from this at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a place for amateur work. Those domestic chores ground you
in daily realities that sometimes go by the name of life. They
connect you with your home, those rooms and furnishings that serve
you without complaint. They bond you to your family, because the
shadow work of housekeeping can be a tangible form of love. The fact
that my mom cooked our meals, washed our clothes, and hung them on a
clothesline to dry—even in winter— and kept our home clean and
orderly, meant so much to my father, sister, brother, and me. Mom
wanted us to have the conditions for a healthy and happy life.
Keeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow work. When
a paid cook, laundress, nanny, or maid does household tasks, the
jobs may be executed very well, but they’re done for a salary, not
from love of family. Inevitably, the work of servants has a
different feeling.</blockquote>
<p>Lambert's version of &quot;Shadow Work&quot; is noticeable less biting than
Illich's. If we accept that supermarkets tricking us with 'self
reliance' to do our own checkout is promoting virtue as a con, it's hard
to see how &quot;[k]eeping house remains the most meaningful form of shadow
work&quot; is any less so. Shadow work that dents the prospects of men like
his father to work up the ladder is bad, shadow work by women that
enabled his father the time to do that is good. I don't mind a
definition of shadow work where it &quot;just is&quot; rather than being bad
(giving free labour) or good (control and privacy) &nbsp;- but when so much
of the tone of the book is&nbsp;&quot;You didn't realise you were doing other
people's jobs for them you sucker&quot; bits like this stick out.</p>
<p><strong>Internships</strong></p>
<blockquote>
The upshot is an army of young people doing full-time shadow work
for months or even years, trying to break into the job market as
unpaid trainees.</blockquote>
<p>Say there's a good book about that...</p>
<blockquote>
The internship juggernaut represents a massive, widespread,
institutionalized form of shadow work. The 2011 exposé Intern
Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New
Economy, by Ross Perlin, offers a biting critique of the internship
explosion.</blockquote>
<p>Which Lambert has also read, so just go read that. Accept these are
related problems&nbsp;but&nbsp;has to be a distinction between consumers taking on
the work of the companies they buy from (doing work that reduces costs
for free) and doing a recognisable job for free (internships). Is a
definition of shadow work that encompasses both actually useful?</p>
<p><strong>Servants and Service</strong></p>
<blockquote>
In the United States, we feel a profound ambivalence about receiving
personal service. In this respect, America differs from the Old
World, where monarchs ruled for centuries. Europeans are accustomed
to royalty, nobility, and aristocracies, settled in their palaces
and great mansions with domestic servants. Indeed, hereditary
monarchs still sit on thrones in Britain, Spain, Luxembourg,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Europe has long lived
with an entrenched class structure that included a servant class
waiting on their “betters.” Consequently, Old World cultures feel a
degree of comfort with personal service.</blockquote>
<p>This is at best simplistic. Lucy Lethbridge's&nbsp;<em>'Servants: A Downstairs
View of Twentieth-century Britain</em>' has an excellent running thread on
the aristocracy slowly learning to do things themselves. For a bit more
historical background on how changes in available labour and funds led
the upper-class to &quot;shadow-work&quot; read that (although &quot;Hey what were the
rich up to?&quot; is not the point of the book).&nbsp;Small snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
Concessions were made towards slightly smaller numbers of household
staff but also to a generation that had begun to enjoy some
independence and was not quite as deficient in practical skills as
its parents’ generation had been. Breakfasts in grand houses, for
example, became increasingly self-service, the dishes arranged on
the sideboard</blockquote>
<p>Bringing the historical picture into it is exactly what a book on
&quot;shadow work&quot; should do (and what Illich does at length with the rise of
wage labour). Is &quot;Removing entry level work reduces social mobility&quot;
just a modern variation of &quot;but how will people become butlers if there
are less entry level servant jobs?&quot; If not, why not? What lessons does
the decline of servants have for the decline of a service-economy?</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;Lambert's assertion that tipping is an Americanism resulting from
an unease to personal service is obviously&nbsp;ahistorical. It's not only a
European import but was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12tipping-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp">resisted by
Americans</a>
at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>This section of the book is pretty clearly padding to reach the word
limit, but by extending the concept to dating it completely falls apart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, people met dating partners through family and
friends, at work, or through hobbies and social events. Today,
various businesses also facilitate linking up. Professional
matchmakers introduce their clients for a fee. Printed or online
personal ads, singles groups and events (not just drinking and
dancing but singles yoga classes, cycling trips, and gardening
clubs), and “speed dating” help make connections. The fact that
these businesses exist testifies that traditional ways of meeting
are no longer getting the job done.</p>
<p>[...]Dating-site questionnaires probe views and preferences to build
personality profiles. The data archive that shadow-working customers
create for free becomes (like Facebook’s content) a valuable capital
asset that the sites can monetize. In one sense, providing this data
is just the obvious ante: You have to pony up information to play
the game. On the other hand, it’s a task that does not arise when
people meet via real social networks rather than virtual ones. In
this way it qualifies as shadow work, as the dating site puts it in
place.</p>
<p>[...]Late-night OkCupid work can mean sleeping less and finding
yourself increasingly fatigued by the shadow work of dating.
“Typically I would send messages back and forth via the site three
times before one of us would suggest exchanging cell phone numbers
to arrange a meeting,” Rachel says. “Once I had someone’s number I
would probably exchange another three text messages to decide on a
place and time and confirm meeting up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really, really pushing it. If &quot;talking to people&quot; is shadow-work
literally anything that involves effort is now shadow-work. Is this
unpaid work that makes wage labour possible? Is it even self-servicing
what used to be done by wage labour? If we accept that amateur labour
(doing work that others would be paid for) counts as shadow-work, then
people match-making their friends is shadow-work because they're doing
work that people are paying online sites to do.&nbsp;The concept as Lambert
uses it means absolutely nothing.</p>

					<p>A 2000 Paul Krugman
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html">article</a>&nbsp;arguing
the problems of rent control was going round twitter yesterday in
response to Miliband rent control proposals in the UK. Ignoring the fact
the Miliband's rent control is a controlled-rise system rather the the
traditional set-up Krugman attacks, anyone who finds his San Francisco
example scary doesn't really understand the current problems in the
housing market:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other side, consider an article that appeared in yesterday's
New York Times, ''In San Francisco, Renters Are Supplicants.'' It
was an interesting piece, with its tales of would-be renters
spending months pounding the pavements, of dozens of desperate
applicants arriving at a newly offered apartment, trying to impress
the landlord with their credentials. And yet there was something
crucial missing -- specifically, two words I knew had to be part of
the story.</p>
<p>Not that I have any special knowledge about San Francisco's housing
market -- in fact, as of yesterday morning I didn't know a thing
about it. But it was immediately obvious from the story what was
going on. To an economist, or for that matter a freshman who has
taken Economics 101, everything about that story fairly screamed
those two words -- which are, of course, ''rent control.''</p>
<p>After all, the sort of landlord behavior described in the article --
demanding that prospective tenants supply resumes and credit
reports, that they dress nicely and act enthusiastic -- <strong>doesn't
happen in uncontrolled housing markets</strong> [emphasis&nbsp;mine]. Landlords
don't want groveling -- they would rather have money. In
uncontrolled markets the question of who gets an apartment is
settled quickly by the question of who is able and willing to pay
the most. And so I had no doubts about what I would find after a bit
of checking -- namely, that San Francisco is a city where a
technology-fueled housing boom has collided with a draconian
rent-control law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to be too scared by this doomsday vision of prospective
tenants at the mercy of strange landlord demands because this is pretty
close to what I've actually experienced. I've <a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/invasive-referencing/">written about it
before</a>
but one place we almost moved the landlord, despite the fact the letting
agent would do a reference check, demanded to see bank statements and
have a meeting with us before accepting our offer. &nbsp;This wasn't a
friendly&nbsp;meeting, it was&nbsp;an aggressive &quot;how do I know you won't leave
early&quot;, &quot;how stable are your jobs&quot;, &quot;you don't have friends and parties
right&quot; meeting.&nbsp;You got the impression quickly he was of the &quot;unexpected
visit&quot; school of bad landlords and having come from another bad landlord
situation we got the deposit back and moved into another place. Here we
spent the next year dealing with mould, rats, mice and cockroaches, but
the choice&nbsp;we made was absolutely the right one. That would not have
been a good landlord to have.</p>
<p>This can't be dismissed as &quot;just one creep&quot;.&nbsp;Looking at bank statements
is a practice defended on landlord forums because of the &quot;risk&quot;
landlords take by being landlords.&nbsp;Another place wasn't even interested
in renting a two double-bedroom place to a group of three because they
were looking for &quot;professionals&quot; rather than people who knew each other
- essentially they wanted people with few connections who would treat
the place as a dormitory&nbsp;rather than a place to be lived or socialised
in&nbsp;(with the &quot;risks&quot; that might entail).</p>
<p>But London doesn't have rent control - if the landlord had so many
offers that they could afford to be picky why don't they just raise the
price? Don't they just want money? The way to make sense of this is&nbsp;that
the wrong people operate the private rental sector. In 2010 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7249/2010380.pdf">a private
landlord&nbsp;survey</a>
found that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Eighty-nine per cent of landlords were private individual landlords
responsible for 71% of all private rented dwellings, with a further
5% of landlords being company landlords responsible for 15% of
dwellings.</li>
<li>More than three quarters (78%) of all landlords only owned a single
dwelling for rent, with only 8% of landlords stating they were full
time landlords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small-scale landlords are the major player in the rental sector and
they're not always going to be good capitalists. The ones that act like
the above&nbsp;are risk-adverse and want their investment bothering them as
little as possible.&nbsp;If the amount of money you are willing to accept to
balance the greater perceived risk is greater&nbsp;than the difference
between the price where you have one buyer and and the price where you
have enough choice to chose less risky tenants, you will charge less
than you can and screen. &nbsp;People who will put up with this before even
moving in are likely to be less troublesome, less likely to make demands
of work that cost money/require attention, less likely to understand
their legal situation, etc. This is a better and more comfortable
position for the investor-landlord.&nbsp;The rate of return&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996">is still
ridiculous</a>&nbsp;regardless.</p>
<p>When people say that rent control means that properties&nbsp;won't be
maintained and landlords will have invasive and offensive tests of
potential tenants I'm not scared of rent control - I'm scared people
don't seem to understand the full extent of the problem. We clearly&nbsp;do
not live&nbsp;a housing market where tenants are only discriminated against
on the size of the wallets - when your uncontrolled situation is pretty
close to the controlled bogeyman something has gone very wrong.</p>

					<p>An
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2015/01/if-you-believe-trans-lives-matter-dont-share-leelah-alcorns-suicide-note-social">article</a>&nbsp;went
up on The New Statesman today arguing&nbsp;that people sharing the suicide
note of a trans-person were actually endangering the very people they
were trying to raise awareness of. This is&nbsp;based on The Samaritans
guidelines&nbsp;that journalists should&nbsp;not print the content of suicide
notes because of the idea of 'suicide contagion' - arguing that
including details of suicide notes can make it more likely people will
try and emulate the note's author.</p>
<p>My opinion of the Samaritan’s guidelines is
they offer&nbsp;good generalised advice that should be read and often
followed. That said, specific guidance is often detached from supporting
evidence and shouldn't be used as an authority to beat people with.
There are circumstances where blindly following guidance has the
potential to do harm and I think this is one of them.</p>
<p>To understand why the contagious understanding of the suicide note is a
bit narrow we need to know a bit more history. I go into this in far
more detail in the finished piece but my basic premise is that over the
last few centuries’ media coverage of suicide played a significant part
in making us a better, kinder&nbsp;society&nbsp;more understanding of
those&nbsp;amongst us most in pain.</p>
<p>To quickly summarise historian Michael MacDonald’s argument [1] -
newspapers secularised suicide by making it a mundane fact of life. The
syndication of suicide stories made the fact of suicide a constant
low-level noise as opposed to something that would happen in smaller
communities incredibly infrequently. From stories of the devil stalking
the earth and taking lives, suicide was enveloped in statistical
reporting. Coverage was often (but not universally) sympathetic. The
focus on the stories of individuals and a large written audience for
stories about suicide created the literary genre of the suicide note
(sometimes helped along&nbsp;by journalists providing them when absent).
Through these notes people tried to shape the narrative of their death
for their community and the wider world.</p>
<p>In step with these developments came near total resistance to sanctions
for the deceased or their survivors, which led to subsequent law
changes. Naturally social change was more complicated than that but the
role of newspapers was important. They made the reader’s world bigger
and the quietest voices louder.</p>
<p>Working from that history I am uncomfortable with the idea that it is
always wrong to print suicide notes and that no good can come of
reporting suicides.</p>
<p>There isn’t a reason given in the Samaritans guide as to why suicide
notes shouldn’t be reported, but working from the general theory
of&nbsp;suicide contagion the fear is that it risks increasing identification
with the deceased and identification might lead to&nbsp;imitation. I dislike
the view that suicide notes should only be seen as infectious spores.
They might also be the last way to understand a person&nbsp;available.</p>
<p>While the evidence for suicide contagion exists (more patchy than often
stated, but still worth taking seriously) this doesn’t apply to all
guidelines proposed. Restrictions on printing suicide method are well
evidenced, most other areas are more theoretical (and I suspect often
derive from backwards engineering terrible reporting – printing suicide
notes is in most cases tacky).</p>
<p>There is a small scientific field concerned with analysing suicide notes
but there is very little published on their effect on suicide contagion.
Niederkrotenthaler and colleagues[2] did investigate if citing a suicide
note effected suicide rates but found no effect – and this lack of
outcome merited no discussion. It’s just not a particular active
question in the field. The only area where a suicide note was discussed
at length I can find was an instance where releasing extracts from a
suicide note was seen as positive. I don’t buy this but it’s worth
looking at to understand solid ground is very hard to find here.</p>
<p>The idea of suicide contagion is best established with celebrity
suicides (Stack’s 2005 meta-analysis of the literature found no
ecological effect on suicide rates had been definitively proven outside
of celebrity studies[3]). As such after Kurt Cobain’s suicide there were
a few attempts to detect an effect in suicide rates. These failed to
find an effect (which is a good thing), and the explanations given for
this in the literature are interesting.</p>
<p>Martin, Graham. “Media Influence to Suicide : The Search for Solutions.”
Archives of Suicide Research 4, no. 1 (2007): 51–66:</p>
<blockquote>
One major difference appears to be the attitude actively promoted by
Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, by his family and subsequently by the
media. Immediately following the death Love made an audiotape
containing excerpts from a note left by Cobain; she commented in a
negative fashion on each part (Gaines, 1994, p. 107). For instance;
“I don’t have the passion anymore, so remember – (And don’t, because
this is a f…ing lie) – It’s better to burn out than fade away (God,
you asshole.) (Sandford, 1995, p.244)”</blockquote>
<p>Gould, M S. “Suicide and the Media.” Annals of the New York Academy of
Sciences 932 (April 2001): 200–214 :</p>
<blockquote>
Yet, celebrity suicides do not always yield imitative suicides, as
evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in suicides
following the death of Kurt Cobain. [...] [T]he substantial efforts
by Kurt Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, to present his suicide in a
negative fashion may have counteracted any potential glamorization
of his death.</blockquote>
<p>The argument essentially goes “there was no imitative effect, therefore
the response did something right”, yet I suspect if you asked Martin if
we should be printing but dismantling suicide notes he wouldn’t argue
for that forcefully. This argument is grasping at straws a little and
paints an overly progressive picture of the media response to Cobain’s
death. If it really was a good response we might need to change media
guides more. After all, the Seattle Times printed a front page image of
Cobain's dead body<a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/126631/how-seattle-times-covered-cobains-death-17-years-ago-today/#more-126631">the next
day</a>on the grounds that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]his picture met that test by establishing an essential reality
about Cobain’s death. Our concern was that Cobain’s suicide would be
romanticized by some – suicide, the ultimate high.</p>
<p>As one editor said, the photo showed, ‘This wasn’t cool, it was
death and that’s the result of suicide.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, media guides would advise against such a thing but they’re
essentially working from the same hymn sheet that you shouldn’t glorify
the dead. Why are the Samaritans right and the Seattle Times wrong?</p>
<p>I want to dismantle the idea of expert opinion a bit here. I don’t think
anyone has any particularly good evidence why there was no detectable
effect after Cobain's suicide and I don’t think anyone has any evidence
that you shouldn’t print suicide notes. I trust well-intentioned people
working at charities trying to save lives a little more than I trust
well-intentioned people who also like to sell newspapers, but simply
having the right&nbsp;intentions is not enough.</p>
<p>Take this situation; we have two sets of well-intentioned people – one
set want to bring wider light to a story in the hope of saving lives,
the other set think this is dangerous because telling this story could
kill more people. This is important stuff, who is right?</p>
<p>Here are the key questions. The Samaritans explicitly state their
guidelines are only advisory;&nbsp;has&nbsp;suicide contagion been demonstrated to
such an&nbsp;extent that there can be no exceptions to guidance? I'd argue
not. Is there any evidence suggesting suicide notes in particular cause
harm? Again, the answer's no.</p>
<p>By all means, be concerned - but let's not pretend anyone knows which
course of action saves more lives.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A side point, but after The Samaritans’ <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/07/samaritans-radar-app-suicide-watch-privacy-twitter-users">Radar controversy</a> worth thinking about.</p>
<p>My thinking on this hasn't solidified yet, but there’s a touch of a
paternalistic attitude towards the mentally ill in the advice not to
print suicide notes. We’re told “avoid the suggestion that a single
incident […] was the cause” - after all suicide is complicated and often
involves mental illness - but also not to report why they said they did
it. The implication here is that these people were not qualified to tell
you why they were suffering. This is even more unsettling when written
by a member of a group who specifically highlights their treatment as
part of that group: “They can’t know what they’re talking about, they’re
ill.&quot;&nbsp;I think this is accepted uncritically a bit wider than it should
be.</p>

					<p>Bob Clarke's 'From Grub Street to Fleet Street: An Illustrated History
of English Newspapers to 1899' (#booksthatgooglegivesyoudirectionsfor)
is a fantastic guide to the development of English newspapers but
importantly also&nbsp;very funny. &nbsp;Clarke has a gift for bringing some of the
more absurd features of the early profession.:</p>
<p><strong>What was Grub Street?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Grub Street is a metaphor for the hack writer. The word ‘hack’
derives from Hackney, originally meaning a horse for hire and later
a prostitute, a woman for hire. Finally, it was applied to a writer
for hire, a newspaper writer or a literary drudge. Paid by the line,
scratching a precarious living from the lower reaches of literature,
including journalism, the Grub Street hack received no public
acclaim, other than the sneers and jibes&nbsp;of his more successful
contemporaries who, by a mixture of ability and sycophancy,
had&nbsp;found the security of a patron.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Newspaper Corrections</strong></p>
<p>Surely one of the best newspaper correction in history belongs to the
Reading Mercury in 1765 - as provincial papers would print pages as news
came in during the week they could end up with corrections on page 2 for
content on page 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Page 1 - The following melancholy accident, we are informed,
happened on Friday last, at a principal Inn on the road to Reading,
viz. As a Gentleman was going up stairs he met the Landlady coming
down, when he insisted upon a kiss, which she complied with; but the
Gentleman not content with that, attempted to put his hand into her
bosom, which she resented, and pushing him from her, he
unfortunately fell down the stairs, broke his neck, and expired soon
after.</p>
<p>Page 3 -The story propagated about town (and which is inserted in
the former part of this paper) of a Gentleman attempting too great a
freedom with the Landlady of a great Inn on the road to Reading, and
that she pushed him down stairs, whereby he was killed, is without
any sort of foundation, no such circumstances having happened or
been attempted; but is supposed to arise from envy; on account of
the great resort of genteel company to the said Inn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The wonderful reason 'The Times' is 'The Times'</strong></p>
<blockquote>
It was founded by John Walter as the Daily&nbsp;Universal Register in
1785. Because the title was so long, people tended to ask for ‘the
Register’, and were likely to end with the Weekly Register, or the
Annual Register, or even Harris’s Register, the list of Covent
Garden whores. So in 1788 Walter remained his paper The Times.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Some traditions started early</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Finally, there was the series of semi-pornographic newsbooks
produced by John Crouch: The Man in the Moon (1649-50), Mercurius
Democritus (1625-43); and Mercurius Fumigosus (1654-55), which
contained a mixture of genuine news and dirty jokes disguised as
news.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Embedded Journalists (or chaplains) in the Prison System</strong></p>
<blockquote>
Fuller accounts were to be found in the threepenny or sixpenny
broadsheets of Dying Confessions that were hawked about the street
after, and sometimes during, the execution. Many of these were the
work of the Ordinary or Chaplain of Newgate. The Ordinary would try
to obtain a full account of the life and crimes of the prisoner in
the condemned cell under the pretense that the prisoner ought to
confess all his sins to make his peace with God. If that did not
work, he would travel in the cart with the condemned&nbsp;man from
Newgate to try and wring some serviceable copy out of him.
Naturally&nbsp;the publicity value would not be so great if the prisoner
was reprieved. The Rev. James Villette once tried to prevent
the&nbsp;last-minute reprive of a fifteen-year-old boy by telling the
hangman&nbsp;to get on with it, as it was too late to worry about such
details.</blockquote>
<p>The whole thing is well worth the read if you ever find yourself with a
copy.</p>

					<p>I set up a quick website to act as a portal for renters to the gov.uk
electoral registration page -
<a class="reference external" href="http://rentersvote.co.uk/">rentersvote.co.uk</a></p>
<p>Thought behind this: I had problems voting this May which I've gone into
more detail on
<a class="reference external" href="http://wf-renters.org.uk/2014/09/21/only-56-of-private-renters-are-registered-to-vote/">here</a>(short&nbsp;story:
moved late, was registered, administrative screw-up, couldn't vote - but
long story is more fun) and I've been thinking about the problem of
renters and elections in general.</p>
<p>The gulf in registration rates between private renters and homeowners is
huge (56 % vs 87%) - the political process is vastly weighted in favour
of current homeowners for various reasons but this&nbsp;bit&nbsp;seems like a
fairly tackle-able handicap.</p>
<p>Registration drives are not really a thing in the UK (while being huge
in the US), the annual canvass&nbsp;does a fairly good job at finding people
who are in the same place year after year - but is terrible at finding
the renters who are in a different place each time (data matching
experiments have been equally unpromising for renters).</p>
<p>The new online voter registration system is a massive improvement on the
previous way you had to register out of cycle (which to remind you: you
had to print off a pdf, write down all your stuff, post it, where
someone else would re-type it in) - this is now a five minute job
anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
<p>This gives a point of an entry for a sectional registration drive. A
scheme targeted at getting private renters on the register should be
able to make an impact on that number.</p>
<p>There's a digital divide issue that'll need to be addressed at some
point (registrations forms are still printable and I created a very
basic flyer as an intermediary thing) but as digital is easier and the
hole in renter registration has a lot of young people who (technically)
use the internet there's a lot of scope in digital before needing to
expand offline.</p>
<p>This increase in renter registration would need to be converted
into&nbsp;greater salience for renter-friendly policies, but that's a
slightly harder problem.</p>
