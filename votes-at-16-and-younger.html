					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/motti82/3599285646/"><img alt="image0" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2477/3599285646_c4c8534cef.jpg" /></a>One thing that's not being appreciated enough (because it's
only exciting to a certain kind of wonk) is how the debates about a
Scottish Independence referendum are systematically going through every
disputed concept in the idea of elections. When is the vote? About what?
How will they vote? Especially disputed is the question of who should
vote: All affected interests? By geography? By blood? And now there's
also the question of if people younger than 18 should be given a say in
their national future. If this goes anywhere, it would be the first UK
referendum which expands rather than contracts the electorate (and would
require the development of a separate voting register for this election
which might be interesting).</p>
<p>The one thing still off-limit is breaking the idea that all voters
should count equally - a rule I'll argue further down that breaking
would actually provide quite a neat solution to the problem of lowering
the voting age - but first let's go into the normal arguments for a bit.
Here we have Angela Constance <a class="reference external" href="http://www.scotreferendum.com/2012/02/01/should-16-and-17-year-olds-vote-in-the-referendum/">making the case
for</a>
letting 16 -and 17-year-olds vote:</p>
<blockquote>
After all, if a 16 year old in Scotland can join the army, get
married and pay taxes – surely he or she should be able to have a
say in this country’s future? That is why in the consultation Your
Scotland, Your Referendum, we are seeking views on extending the
right to vote in this referendum to 16 and 17 year olds who are
eligible to be included on the electoral register.</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual trio brought up to demonstrate the unfairness of the
current voting age. The object here is to show that we are in some way
being inconsistent in handling the maturity of 16 year olds without
relying on the slippery slope of 'maturity'. In Scotland the marriage
thing holds (In England and Wales there's a parental consent requirement
below 18) but the army item has gotten more tenuous as although 16 year
olds can join the army <a class="reference external" href="http://www.defencemanagement.com/feature_story.asp?id=15592">they're not actually allowed to deploy anywhere
till they're
18</a>.</p>
<p>The tax argument is worth going into. The idea that there's a connection
between taxation and representation is an old one but not necessarily a
particularly good one to demonstrate inconsistency - being consistent on
it would require us to do far more than allow 16-year-olds to vote. For
a start, we actually let children pay taxes far earlier than 16, any
time a child saves up and buys anything with VAT they're tax-payers.
True at 16 someone can work full time and pay income tax, but there's no
real reason to connect this kind of tax to the franchise and no other.
From the other end we don't take away the right to vote from adult
unemployed people or those in full-time education who similarly have the
potential to be tax-payers but aren't. To be consistent, if it's the
ability to pay tax that's important we must enfranchise anyone who can
earn and spend anything, or if we are treating income tax as a special
case then we need to disenfranchise anyone who is not paying income tax
(in which case the Lib Dem policy of raising the personal threshold
wouldn't be a way of relieving the tax burden on the poorest but a
sneaky way of disenfranchising them).</p>
<p>What this argument is basically getting at is the idea that we have a
norm for granting a set of rights at 16 and voting rights should be
included in it. This is a helpful argument for advocates of lowering the
voting age because it allows an appeal to precedent and doesn't rely
directly on the nebulous idea of 'maturity' - a problematic idea because
there's inevitably only a small difference between each age cohort
making it hard to draw the process to a stop (if we let 18 year olds,
why not 17? And if them why not 16? And if them, why not... and so on).</p>
<p>The trouble with this is that it's hard to see why this logic doesn't
also apply to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/subsites/kccentral/yourvoice/yourrights/yourrightsat18.aspx">any other
right</a>
gained at 18. The basic challenge of 'we grant right X at 16, how is it
just that we grant right Y at 18?' applies to all of them. If children
are considered mature enough to have opinions on keeping Trident, why
shouldn't they be allowed to buy fireworks? Taken to its conclusion this
is saying is that adulthood begins at 16, not that children should vote.</p>
<p>There's not necessarily anything wrong with this idea, a society based
on this would be different but not unthinkable, but accepting this puts
an end to the idea of graduated maturity. <a class="reference external" href="http://ann.sagepub.com/content/633/1/141">Andrew Rehfeld
argues</a> that the defining
feature of childhood maturity isn't that it is or isn't present but that
it is 'in development' and I think this chimes with how many people
instinctively feel about the subject. Many 16 year olds are on average
probably mature enough to be citizens, but 18 year olds are on average
more so and 14-year-olds on average less so - hence a structure that
grants legal rights at intervals and removes qualifications on rights as
a person ages seems to fit nicely into this. So given this, how should
voting rights be handled? Highest bundle? Lowest? Rehfeld leans on the
idea of California state senator John Vasconcellos, who argued that
rather than debate at which point we turn on voting rights, we should do
it gradually and give fractional votes to citizens under the age of 18.</p>
<p>Rehfeld actually goes far further than most child voting supporters, not
simply arguing that 16-year-olds should have half a vote until they turn
18, but that we should go far lower and each year from 12 a person
should gain 1/7 of a vote until they have their full vote at 18
(Vasconcellos's fractions were <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Wheels_for_Citizenship">different but same basic
idea</a>).
The basic idea of gradualism I think is a good one because it sidesteps
the problem of a 'race to the bottom' above as this approach reflects
differences in maturity rather than similarities.&nbsp;Practically the vote
count would be different but not&nbsp;unmanageable&nbsp;and could still be done
with a hand count - at it's most basic you could use&nbsp;separate&nbsp;registers
for each birth year, colour-code the voting slips and then count these
votes&nbsp;separate&nbsp;from the main piles. Counting the different cohorts in
series would add little difficulty over simply increasing the number of
voters.</p>
<p>Now that some people should have greater voting power than others is a
commonly-had and commonly-rejected idea. Ultimately that each person has
one vote is a compromise, as any other scheme arguing that certain
citizens are wiser and so should have greater voting powers would not be
generally accepted and so would undermine rather than enrich the
democratic process. I think children are a special case in this sense as
the fractional vote represents a process rather than permanent division.
It's not an argument that a certain race or gender's votes are worth
less, or that any particular&nbsp;qualification&nbsp;should give more voting power
- simply that children start off immature and progress towards maturity
and they should have a voting power that reflects this reality.&nbsp;It
allows for what I think is a reasonably common sense view on the
maturity of children to be expressed, while at the same time recognizing
that children represent real interests (that are distinct from any other
group) and should have a say in matters.</p>
<p>Even as a reduced voting block this would still introduce
a&nbsp;sizeable&nbsp;number of people to the electorate so the result is far from
a token vote, and as a result children would grow and be socialized into
citizenship rather than having it thrust on them all at once. This is a
more radical approach than votes at 16, but I think it ultimately
accomplishes the same aims better and - rather than creating a new
voting age with the same justifications waiting in the wings to lower it
again - would create a future-proof framework for dealing with child
voters. Best case, this gives us a political system more tuned to the
needs and concerns of the young (and by proxy, future generations) and
more children who enter adulthood as politically aware individuals.
Worst case, we add a few more voters to the large number who already
have no idea what they're doing. &nbsp;On the basis of that highly slanted
weighing up of the facts, it'd be silly not to think about it.</p>
