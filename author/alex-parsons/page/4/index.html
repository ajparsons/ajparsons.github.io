					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?ID=292466&amp;R=R1&amp;utm_">Gilad Sharon's &quot;Flatten Gaza&quot;
article</a>
in the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post&nbsp;has been rightly widely condemned as being a
pretty horrible thing for a mainstream newspaper to publish (even
bearing in mind the&nbsp;Jerusalem&nbsp;Post also published a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkprogress.org/security/2011/07/25/277863/wsj-jerusalem-post-norway-terrorist-had-a-point/">he went too far,
but is he
wrong?</a>&quot;&nbsp;article
after&nbsp;Brievik), one part especially jumped out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
THE DESIRE to prevent harm to innocent civilians in Gaza will
ultimately lead to harming the truly innocent: the residents of
southern Israel. <strong>The residents of Gaza are not innocent, they
elected Hamas. The Gazans aren’t hostages; they chose this freely,
and must live with the consequences.</strong></blockquote>
<p>If you remember 7/7 bomber&nbsp;Mohammad Sidique Khan's suicide tape, that
might be
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm">familiar&nbsp;sentiment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Your <strong>democratically elected governments</strong> continuously perpetuate
atrocities against my people all over the world.&nbsp;And <strong>your support
of them makes you directly responsible</strong>, just as I am directly
responsible for protecting and avenging my Muslim brothers and
sisters.</blockquote>
<p>The principle here is simple: we elect our leaders, if our leaders chose
to wage war with our support then we are all legitimate targets, in or
out of uniform, on or off the battlefield. &nbsp;It's not just to weaken the
material war effort or 'morale' of the enemy (dodgy, but anyway),
democratic civilians are morally culpable and so&nbsp;indiscriminate&nbsp;violence
can be justified.</p>
<p>As it happens Sharon is just plain wrong on the facts, Hamas did win the
2006 elections but the current Hamas government in Gaza results from a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/15/israel4">2007 takeover</a>.
More interesting for this question is exactly why they won in 2006 - <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/jps.2006.35.3.20">a
combination of the electoral system and severe splits within
Fatah</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Post-election surveys showed the price of this disunity, a
distortion magnified&nbsp;by an electoral system under which half the
seats were won in district races[at-large elections with multiple
seats] and the other half—the national list—were allocated according
to the list’s&nbsp;proportion of the national vote. Thus, Hamas won 29
seats (against Fatah’s 28)&nbsp;in the 66-seat national list with 44
percent of the vote. The non-Hamas vote&nbsp;(56 percent)was divided
between Fatah and the four other PLO or “Third Way”&nbsp;lists. But while
Hamas candidates won 45 (68 percent) of the 66 district seats&nbsp;in
parliament, they did so with 36.5 of the vote. Sixty-three percent
voted for&nbsp;non-Hamas candidates, the vast majority dispersed between
Fatah’s official and&nbsp;independent candidates. In the end, Fatah won a
mere 17 seats in the districts.&nbsp;On the basis of these figures it is
difficult to refute Awad’s conclusion. “Hamas&nbsp;did not win the
elections—Fatah lost them.” (p.26)</blockquote>
<p>That 36.5% figure is interesting because Labour in the 2005 elections
won with just a percent less, on 35.2% percent of the vote. &nbsp;In both
cases the 'culpable party' won with far less than majority support - can
we really say there's a lot of collective&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;there?</p>
<p>But wait - those are the figures for the whole of Palestine - maybe the
Gaza districts were more Hamas hardcore. No such luck, using the break
down of results from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/Palestine2006-NDI-final.pdf">Carter Center
report</a>
I made this table of how the vote played out (remember it's at-large
districts- as many votes as seats open - so there are many more votes
than voters):</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="18%" />
<col width="44%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="17%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>District</strong></td>
<td><strong>Votes for Change &amp; Reform (Hamas)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Total Votes</strong></td>
<td>**&nbsp;% Hamas**</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>North Gaza</td>
<td>170021</td>
<td>363832</td>
<td>46.73%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Gaza</td>
<td>364529</td>
<td>941959</td>
<td>38.70%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Deir al-Balah</td>
<td>79594</td>
<td>253882</td>
<td>31.35%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Khan Younis</td>
<td>160014</td>
<td>531480</td>
<td>30.11%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Rafah</td>
<td>61936</td>
<td>153247</td>
<td>40.42%</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Total</td>
<td>836094</td>
<td>2244400</td>
<td>37.25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So even just within Gaza it's hard to argue Hamas had overwhelming
support.&nbsp;It's also worth remembering that Gaza has <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gz.html">a pretty high
proportion of
children</a>
(43.8% - 0-14) and so democratic decisions by the adult population
have&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://alexparsons.co.uk/blog/2012/10/democracy-is-disruptive/">more potential legitimacy
problems</a>&nbsp;than
might otherwise be the case. Saying children 'chose freely' to be bombed
because less than half of adults voted for a party six years ago might
be pushing democratic accountability a bit far.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/13147230-198x300.jpg" />After reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2012/11/terry-pratchett-sex-death-and-nature">this great
interview</a>
with Terry Pratchett&nbsp;I decided to go back and finish this post I was
writing about <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth">*The Long
Earth*</a>, Pratchett's
recent collaboration with Stephen Baxter.&nbsp;Obviously, spoilers spoilers.</p>
<p>Basic setting summary: In <em>The Long Earth</em>, someone releases schematics
on the internet for an easy to build box with a switch. When the switch
is pressed, the user can travel either 'east' or 'west' through
infinite&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;Earths, with the near Earths being very similar to the
original 'datum' earth (but lacking in people) with weirder and wilder
creatures waiting in the far off Earths.&nbsp;One of the fun things about
reading collaborations between well-known authors is trying to break
down who introduced what elements.&nbsp;Sometimes you can pick up the voices,
but in cases like the Long Earth tracking the lineage of the ideas
involved is illuminating.&nbsp;While based on an old idea of Pratchett's, the
threads of it have appeared in a few previous Baxter books (which is
probably why the project is such a good fit.)</p>
<p>In Baxter's <em>Origin</em>, the world is changed by the&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;of the Red
Moon (which replaces the boring grey one). The Red Moon travels
from&nbsp;parallel&nbsp;earth to parallel earth, opening up portals and picking up
and depositing creatures from world to world. Through this, it picked up
humanity's&nbsp;predecessors at various points in history and deposited them
on other earths, where they evolve in different and similar ways,
aquatic apes, puritans with tails, super-intelligent&nbsp;gorillas who hug
the surface of their gigantic and windswept Earth. So the idea that
there are places beside our own where humanity's cousins (in <em>The Long
Earth</em>'s case Trolls and Elves) developed in their own strange ways is
a&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>That Trolls are largely peaceful creatures who make people feel better
by singing while Elves are intelligent, malicious hunters where some
species farm others for their brains fits into the Pratchett&nbsp;rebellion
against Tolkien regarding elves (from <em>Lords and Ladies)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are terrific. They beget terror.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a
snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words
that have changed their meaning.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">No one ever said elves are nice.</div>
<div class="line">Elves are bad.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Long Earth</em> is also an example of, &nbsp;for lack of a better term,
&quot;Democratic Science Fiction&quot; - where an extraordinary change is put in
the hands of every person.&nbsp;What's a world like where everyone has
superpowers?&nbsp;&nbsp;When anyone can travel in time? When anyone can get a
potato and a switch, and step into another earth? This is ground Baxter
has visited before in a previous&nbsp;collaboration with Arthur C. Clark in
<em>The Light Of Other Days</em>, where the invention of wormhole technology
allows anyone to view any location, anywhere in history - effectively
abolishing privacy.</p>
<p>Lobsang is an interesting element, a sentient computer that claims to be
the reincarnated soul of a&nbsp;Tibetan&nbsp;car mechanic.&nbsp;Someone obscure
being&nbsp;reincarnated&nbsp;as a computer feels like a classic Pratchett&nbsp;footnote
joke (and there has been a 'Lobsang' in the Discworld-verse) , but it's
tempered and kept in line with a sci-fi universe by the heavy hinting
that Lobsang is just pretending to be reincarnated&nbsp;to have a better
claim to have personhood rights. To make an end of paragraph habit,
Baxter's collaboration with Clarke in the <em>Time Odyssey</em>&nbsp;series also
featured AI's with recognised rights.</p>
<p>You might guess from how often I've referred back to his previous books
that this story 'feels' more like Baxter than Pratchett but
his&nbsp;sensibilities&nbsp;are clearly there if you look. I wouldn't say it's
either of their greatest works, but it's a perfectly enjoyable read that
plays with its world in a way that I'm not sure would have come
naturally to either of them on their own.</p>

					<p>The other month someone posted this classic 'politicians are awful'
viral story on Facebook, &nbsp;I was reading&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">David Graeber's
Debt</a> at the
same time and it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me what a wonderful summation this story is
of a certain kind of debt morality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day a florist went to a barber for a haircut. After the cut, he
asked about his bill, and the barber replied, 'I cannot accept money
from you; I'm doing community service this week.' The florist was
pleased and left the shop. When the barber went to open his shop the
next morning, there was a 'thank you' card and a dozen roses waiting
for him at his door.</p>
<p>Later, a cop comes in for a haircut, and when he tries to pay his
bill, the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you; I'm
doing community service this week.' The cop was happy and left the
shop. The next morning when the barber went to open up, there was a
'thank you' card and a dozen doughnuts waiting for him at his door.</p>
<p>Then an MP came in for a haircut, and when he went to pay his bill,
the barber again replied, 'I cannot accept money from you. I'm doing
community service this week.' The MP was very happy and left the
shop. The next morning, when the barber went to open up, there were
a dozen MPs lined up waiting for a free haircut.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, illustrates the fundamental difference between
the citizens of our country and the politicians who run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we have the evil MPs (it's an anglicised&nbsp;US story, other versions
on the internet use 'politicians') are happy to take the humble barber
for all they can, while the upstanding members of the community show
their gratitude with gifts, and are thus good people.</p>
<p>But wait, wasn't the barber trying to perform community service? Didn't
he say he didn't want money? Why is it good to sneakily leave gifts of,
in the florist's case, at least equivalent&nbsp;monetary value when he can't
refuse? The barber tried to give to the community but the cop and the
florist go against his wishes and try to pay him, because of the
discomfort of the cop and florist to even the perception of being in
another's debt.</p>
<p>Graeber comes into this because he argues that the role of barter is to
manage goods between strangers but in long-standing communities credit
arrangements dominate. Something that caught my eye was that in some
societies, to try to clear all debts would be an absurdity because to
try would be to decide not to be a member of the community.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it's the florist and cop who are determined to
treat the barber as a stranger by not allowing a debt to stand
uncompensated,&nbsp;whereas the MP spreads word of someone who wants to give
and gives them the opportunity to give more. Who's really the bad guy in
this scenario?&nbsp;I find it interesting how revealing a story clearly meant
to represent 'common sense' is about a particular modern idea of debt
and community.</p>

                </h2>

					<p>PCC turnout&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20374139">turned out to be a historic
low</a> and this is raising some
questions about the legitimacy of elections with low turnouts. &nbsp;What
does it mean for an election if almost no-one takes part?</p>
<p>One thing that elections are claimed to do is 'authorise', but there
tends to be fuzziness on exactly what that means. The general problem
when defining what 'authorising' means in an election is that having a
definition creates the possibility of elections that fail to meet that
definition. &nbsp;One possible escape from this is to use the argument that
'authorising' collapses quickly into tacit consent, where a&nbsp;typical
series of moves might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming majority rule is valid, if more than half of a population
agree to authorize the same person, then the election has authorized
that person.&nbsp;But wait, many elections are won by people without
majorities - how can they be authorised?</p>
<p>Well, let's say that by taking part in an election, they decide to
accept the end of the process is authorised. Collectively over 50%
agree to this, the 40% winner is authorised. But wait,&nbsp;&nbsp;some
elections have less than 50% turnout! How can that count?</p>
<p>Well, by opting to live in a democratic society people agree to
abide by certain rules, which includes accepting the winner of
elections as authorized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each stage makes the claim to authorisation more flimsy (I think it's
still valid as far as the second stage) and the trouble is this
quick&nbsp;collapses into tacit consent makes all discussion of authorisation
in elections pretty much meaningless. If&nbsp;absolutely every election can
be said to authorize the winner, it really has no meaning.</p>
<p>The way out of this hole where we obviously have some elections that no
reasonable standard could call authorising is that not all elections
need to involve authorisation: elections can either be authorizing or
consultative. &nbsp;Authorising elections perform the function of the people
empowering a person/chamber to act and take decisions on their behalf,
whereas consultative elections are essentially very official polls. &nbsp;The
logic in the case of PCC elections would be roughly the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Elections can either be exercises in authorization or
consultation.</li>
<li>Not all elections achieve 50% (notably local elections and
referenda).</li>
<li>An authorised chamber has the power to delegate its authority on
certain matters to sub-chambers staffed by whatever process it
chooses, including consultative elections.</li>
<li>A chamber elected with less than 50% turnout can legitimately
take decisions if its authority is established by a superior
chamber with sufficient authorisation.</li>
<li>The same logic allows referenda with less than 50% turnout to be
acted on.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Under this logic, PCC elections are fine no matter how low the turnout,
as they're a consultative election - if they were appointed or picked
out of a hat, they would be equally authorised. &nbsp;The question is then if
elections with low turnout are a good or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/pcc-elections-what-price-democracy">cost
effective</a>
method of picking the right people for the job, which an interesting and
important question - but one detached from legitimacy and authorisation.</p>
<p>This passes a low bar for a definition of authorisation in that there
are some possible elections that would not be authorised, elections to
the superior chamber need to have at least 50% turnout (and as such
the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Central_by-election,_2012">Manchester Central
by-election</a>
result would&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;fall short).&nbsp;There is a final dodge&nbsp;available&nbsp;to
MPs in the&nbsp;British&nbsp;system - that their elections can be seen as
consultative as &nbsp;their power comes from the crown - &nbsp;but this is a bit
of a unique case and is growingly out of step with the expanded role of
the&nbsp;British&nbsp;electorate in recent decades.</p>
<p>This approach isn't just saying that one set of elections needs 50% - in
federal arrangements where different powers are sent to different
places, multiple bodies would need to be elected by authorising
elections. Likewise there'd be a strong case for requiring 50% turnout
on constitutionally required referendums. If elections have an
authorising role then turnout has to, at least sometimes, be practically
significant. How this would actually be managed practically (delay
November by-elections till May?) is a different question.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/TWD-game-cover-286x300.jpg" />I've been a fan of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/">Telltale</a> since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Lw312RrXk">Sam &amp;
Max</a> games and in recent
games started to notice a trend towards games that had some
consideration of ethical issues. In their <em>Jurassic Park</em> game
characters have a lengthy debate about the morality of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency">lysine
contingency</a>,
and in their <em>Back to the Future</em> game a version of Emmett Brown
pointedly asks what gives you (Marty) the right to use time travel to
decide which people should and shouldn't be living happy lives in 1985.
While I ended up being disappointed by the game&nbsp;ending in both cases, I
was impressed at how Telltale had found ways to mine&nbsp;the world of
the&nbsp;franchises they're playing in&nbsp;and ask interesting ethical questions
about them. While the show version of <em>The Walking Dead</em> has issues, I
was interested to see what Telltale would do with a world that was
essentially always about making difficult ethical choices.</p>
<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> game exists in roughly the same world as the comics
and TV show&nbsp;(not aware if it's considered in the same canon as either,
although there is some character overlap) where the world is overrun by
a zombie&nbsp;apocalypse and the driving narrative force is dealing with&nbsp;how
people exist with uncomfortable decisions and the end of
civilisation.&nbsp;Gameplay is relatively simple, the majority of the game is
spent going between cut-scenes and dialogue options, where&nbsp;your choices
of dialogue will affect your relationship with other characters,
affecting future dialogue.&nbsp;There are also scenes where there is freedom
to roam and accomplish traditional point-and-click game tasks, or&nbsp;action
sequences with Quick Time events.</p>
<p>At the start of each episode the game tells you: '<em>This game series
adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.'</em>
However what becomes apparent quite quickly is that your ability to make
choices that drastically affect the story is quite limited but what I
found especially interesting after playing the first few episodes was
how this made the game better at being an 'ethics game' than an
endlessly branching story might be.</p>
<p>To take a typical choice, there's a situation where you can choose to
act morally, but this will cause you to have less time to gather
supplies. However aside from some dialogue about this the supplies
themselves mean nothing, this isn't a game with health bars and you are
physically able to carry out the same tasks no matter how much your
character has eaten.&nbsp;Similarly a decision whether or not to take
supplies from a possible abandoned car doesn't matter, your group will
survive and be alive and well in the next episode anyway.</p>
<p>To an extent this is making lives easier for the developers who don't
have to track and script every possible divergent fork.&nbsp;Unlike some text
adventure games it won't severely punish you hours down the line from a
decision made early on (and most decisions that cause divergent paths
collapse to the same outcome, if through slightly different means), all
death events are caused by&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;button mashing and there are
very few places where you can through dialogue choices lead to a 'game
over'. However, practical&nbsp;considerations&nbsp;aren't the only ones here and I
think the general inflexibility of the game world goes&nbsp;some way&nbsp;towards
making this an interestingly ethics-based game.</p>
<p>In trying to work out how to account for ethical choices in a game like
this I was reminded of a season two episode of <em>Angel</em> -
'<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(Angel)">Epiphany</a>'. In
this episode&nbsp;Angel, who had seen himself as a pivotal player in the
battle between good and evil, realises what a small player he really is
and decides that if the big ends are unchangeable then how he chooses to
act is the only thing that matters -&nbsp;&quot;If nothing we do matters, then all
that matters is what we do&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a credo that carries over well to The Walking Dead.&nbsp;Your
character simply does not have the power to influence the world around
him to huge degrees. We, as players, know that the world is on rails and
certain events are inevitable regardless of our choices but the
reactions of other characters are flexible enough to our choices that
there is a sense of immersion and weight to choices we make. &nbsp;The key
question here is if your character is powerless to prevent or control
his fate, does it make choosing to behave ethically more or less
meaningful?</p>
<p>My thinking is that this lack of control takes away a lot of traditional
gaming thinking from the player. If it was possible to prevent every
death, there'd be incentive for people to see each death as a failure
and constantly reload in search of that '100% complete' achievement (à
la&nbsp;<em>Heavy Rain</em>).&nbsp;By keeping choices about choosing sides (and
aligning yourself with various other characters), the game sidesteps the
problem of creating right and wrong answers to puzzles - there are
simply choices you make. And if these choices have no effect on 'game
score' - then there is no disincentive to role play.</p>
<p>How do you decide which four out of ten people will get food?&nbsp;You can
play it by who you want to keep 'on side' but as established that
doesn't matter-matter &nbsp;- by taking away practical gaming considerations
the game makes you consider what you would do in those circumstances.
&nbsp;When the game offered me a choice of keeping the last piece of food for
myself, I&nbsp;was stuck on that decision for a minute or so - without
in-game&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;our own sense of ethics can be fully engaged.</p>
<p>However, the flip side is the question of can a game that doesn't make
you suffer for picking morally better
but&nbsp;practically&nbsp;disadvantageous&nbsp;decisions really be asking you to make
meaningful decisions?&nbsp;To which I'd answer that meaningful in the game
and meaningful to the player are quite different things.&nbsp;By turning off
gamer logic, the game changes the basis you make decisions on. You're
not choosing which version of the game you want to be playing an hour
down the line but are forced to make decisions based on personal
considerations.</p>
<p>So while <em>The Walking Dead</em> may in some senses be far more linear than
it's described as, the linear plot creates room for an interesting kind
of sandbox ethics game. Even if most choices don't matter to the story,
they do matter to you.</p>

					<p>Something caught my eye in the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Agreement-final-for-signing.pdf">draft section 30
order</a>
to empower the Scottish Parliament to pass&nbsp;legislation&nbsp;on
an&nbsp;independence&nbsp;referendum:</p>
<blockquote>
[4 (2)] In those provisions as applied by this article, references,
however expressed, to a person or body designated under section 108
[of Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]&nbsp;are to be
read as references to a person or body designated under an Act of
the Scottish Parliament for the purposes of an independence
referendum as representing those campaigning for a particular
outcome in relation to the question in the referendum.</blockquote>
<p>This in interesting because <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/108">section
108</a>&nbsp;gives
the power to appoint&nbsp;designated&nbsp;campaigns (who gain
certain&nbsp;financial&nbsp;assistance, access to broadcast and freepost) to the
Electoral Commission - instead this is indicating the Scottish
Parliament will have the ability to directly&nbsp;designate&nbsp;campaigns for the
respective sides.&nbsp;As there's yet to be a case where there was serious
competition between two groups for the same designated status this seem
relatively&nbsp;harmless, although technically this would also allow one
campaign to be&nbsp;designated&nbsp;without the other (seems unlikely).&nbsp;The
Scottish Parliament could of course pass this back to the Electoral
Commission when they come to legislate.</p>
<p>Update:&nbsp;The memorandum of agreement seems to be stating that the
Electoral Commission should retain its role of 'designating lead
campaign organisations' which makes the above curious. I suspect in the
grand scheme of things it's doing absolutely nothing, but I'm just not
sure why it's there at all.</p>
<p>4.1 (a) in the s 30 order directly refers to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/section/127">s 127 of
PPERA</a>,
which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
A broadcaster shall not include in its broadcasting services any
referendum campaign broadcast made on behalf of any person or body
other than one designated in respect of the referendum in question
<strong>under section 108</strong>.</blockquote>
<div><p>&nbsp;And I'm wondering if 4.2 is then just being over&nbsp;cautious&nbsp;in relation
to this. If the Electoral Commission retains its designation powers,
those groups will be designated by s 108 and be counted under that
anyway. If that's the explanation, then 4.2 isn't needed at all and is
actually transferring more than they intended to the Scottish
Parliament, allowing it to designate extra groups that could make
election broadcasts and mailshots (not a hugely useful power but hey).</p>
