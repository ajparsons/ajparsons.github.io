                </h2>
				Feb 03, 2012
                
				
					<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EYhVwPqCQ">this video</a>
emerged on the Internet of Boris Johnson being chased outside City Hall
by a man in a chicken suit:</p>
<p>As it turns out this chicken isn't even chasing the actual Boris, giving
us a man wearing a chicken suit chasing a man dressed a man with a fake
blonde wig, being&nbsp;filmed with a shaky camera for authenticity. It's a
strange world we live in, but stranger still is that following
politicians while wearing chicken-suits has a long and proud&nbsp;history.
&nbsp;As far as I can tell, it started in America when Gerald Ford <a class="reference external" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/leadership-management/120064/tales-of-a-serial-prankster-interviewing-the-president-while-wearing-a-chicken-suit/">addressed
the chicken
mascot</a>
of a local radio station while on campaign - a New York Times reporter
then promptly bought the costume off the station and showed up to a
press event in it as a prank (<a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/22347153">video
here</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/chicken-300x173.png:target:/uploads/chicken.png" /></p>
<p>The chicken then went dormant for a while, reappearing in 1992 <a class="reference external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b5NGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4586,977613">working
for
Clinton</a>&nbsp;(great
illustration in that article) as 'Chicken George', but this time around
the chicken had a political objective. The job of this chicken was hound
George H. W. Bush for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/01/news/01iht-deba.html">stonewalling debate
negotiations</a>&nbsp;and
this has been a recurring use of chicken suits since. This version of
the chicken I'm assuming is the inspiration for events in&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://westwing.bewarne.com/sixth/615fredonia.html">season six
of the West
Wing</a>&nbsp;where&nbsp;Josh
Lyman similarly deploys&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;in chicken suits to hound opponents
who wouldn't debate his candidate.</p>
<p>The Chicken crossed the Atlantic for the 1997 election, giving us the
'Tory Chicken', who followed Tony Blair to highlight that he had
declined to debate John Major. For some reason this triggered a
previously unknown British capacity for animal-suit politics, spawning a
fox to chase the chicken off and a rhinoceros&nbsp;opposed to the idea of
animal suits entirely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chicken was to follow the Labour leader, who was campaigning in
the marginal Tory seat held by Michael Forsyth, the Scottish
Secretary. However, his efforts to henpeck Mr Blair were hampered by
a man from the Scottish Daily Mirror dressed as Freddy the Fox, who
blocked his path during a 15-minute walkabout.</p>
<p>As Mr Blair approached, the chicken was seen to stumble and was
pushed to the back of the crowd surrounding the Labour leader, where
it waved a placard before skulking off. A jubilant Freddy observed:
&quot;I had him for dinner. I stopped him getting anywhere near Tony.
Tony shook my hand and thanked me for it.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Mr Blair's guardian refused to identify himself, saying:
&quot;The whole thing is embarrassing enough as it is.&quot; The incident came
at the end of a traumatic day for the Tory chicken. Earlier, he got
into a nasty fight with a rival chicken with a detachable head, sent
by the Mirror newspaper, as he strutted across College Green in
Westminster. He was also pursued across London by another fox, two
teddy bears and a plastic rhinoceros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/site/rantext/random-politics/the-tory-chicken-loses-its-head">That whole
article</a>
is worth a read if only for the full description of the Chicken's fight
with the Mirror Chicken (the Mirror would go on to send another chicken
<a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8633049.stm">after
Cameron</a>,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/09/article-1275443-097E59F4000005DC-503_634x424.jpg">Clegg</a>&nbsp;and
probably others&nbsp;in the 2010 election).&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Finkelstein has a good
story about having to keep the Chicken motivated during the campaign,
but it's sadly now lost behind the Times paywall. In happier
news,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://takingliberties.squarespace.com/taking-liberties/2010/4/18/class-of-97-tony-blair-and-the-tory-chicken.html">here's the
story</a>
of its visit to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Chickens have also popped up in
<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.canoe.ca/raisinghell/general/doer-smarter-than-your-average-chicken/">Canadian&nbsp;provincial&nbsp;elections</a>
so there's a fair chance&nbsp;I've missed several chicken sightings but the
idea of using chickens to draw attention to lack of debates (and assign
blame) seem to be a recurring thing here. Given this back story, what do
we make of this latest chicken? &nbsp;That the real Boris doesn't even appear
in Ken's chicken's videos so far (and that it's not explained in video
why there's a chicken) is interesting as the chicken&nbsp;usually&nbsp;tries to
muscle in on it's target's event and steal the focus.&nbsp;Is chasing fake
Boris a sign of laziness or a sign that the media landscape is changing
and our use of chicken suits with it? &nbsp;Do&nbsp;we now understanding a chicken
suit as short-hand for dodging debates? Or does the lack of context of
the clip&nbsp;reflect the changing face of media, that it's now better to get
a short and intriguing video on the internet and draw people to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.borisjohnshen.com/">your
site</a> than to try and worm in at your
opponent's own media events?</p>
<p>For entirely unrelated reasons, <a class="reference external" href="http://theweek.com/article/index/203347/voting-in-nevada-dont-wear-a-chicken-suit">you can't vote in a chicken-suit in
Nevada</a>.</p>
