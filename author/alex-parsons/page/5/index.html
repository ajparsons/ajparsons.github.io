					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/100322-cam1-300x149.jpg" />This is clearly a Question To Which The Answer Is No, but bear
with me a minute. While researching for my Masters dissertation I spent
some time looking at how various&nbsp;countries&nbsp;deal with accuracy
requirements in&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising - I might convert some of my
conclusions into blog form at some point but in the meantime I'll share
a complaint I found quite funny. In New Zealand rules about accuracy in
broadcast and print apply to&nbsp;political&nbsp;advertising (although this is a
rare event) and looking through the 2008 cases I found a wonderful
complaint to their Advertising Standards Agency by a man who claimed
that then PM Helen Clark was misleading the electorate by using a
photoshopped image of herself on posters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The consumer in this instance is the voting public. &nbsp;Clearly what is
represented as the image of Helen Clark is intended to appeal to a
younger less knowledgeable voter. &nbsp;The Labour Party have used this
exaggerated image of a youthful vibrant younger woman as the face of
the Party to mislead the voting decisions of a less knowledgeable
group.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The visual image in the Billboard is clearly intended to mislead,
and the standard has been set by your sister organisation – the BSA
in its ruling against TV3[*]. &nbsp;They had nothing to gain from using
an actor to voice over an interview, the Labour Party have
everything to gain from misleading the voting public – even if only
by a few votes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ASA rejected this, arguing that &quot;it was common practice in a
wide-range of sectors for people to take additional care with their
appearance when their image was used for publicity purposes&quot; - what
makes this extra wonderful is that the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;appealed this
decision, arguing that using photoshopped images was so deceitful it
brought the integrity of the whole party into question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Labour Party has framed Election 08 around the issue of Trust.
This is probably the most important election we as a nation has
faced for many years. As such every vote cast is important and the
voting public need to be protected from the misleading visual image
projected in the billboards (and other media).</p>
<p>A commercial trader potently can make financial gain by presenting
goods or services with professionally enhanced images. By way of
example if a used car dealer advertised an image of a vehicle that
looked pristine, then when it was inspected it was found to have
rust, mismatched paint, and no mag wheels, then the dealer is in
breach of the guidelines and consumer laws. Your august body acting
on the initiative of a complaint from the public would review the
standards and apply a ruling to remove the offending advertisement.</p>
<p>In summary, as a concerned citizen I feel compelled to act and voice
my opinion that the political party trying to project &quot;Trust&quot; as the
major focus of this election is able to knowing promote itself with
a visual presentation that is clearly and intentionally designed to
mislead a segment of the voting public and gain the favour of those
less knowledgeable. As such the billboards in question breach the
standard set out in Rule 2.</p>
<p>This is not just another advertisement by a dodgy car dealer or a
dramatization from an enthusiastic broadcaster - it is vital that
this appeal is considered carefully as it has serious and far
reaching implications for the future of New Zealand.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which didn't find much favour with the appeal board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Acting Chairperson said that the identity of the Advertiser in
this Advertisement was clear, both through the authorisation
statement, the use of the identifiable party colours and name, and
through the image of the leader of the party. Regarding the question
of fact and opinion, the Acting Chairperson agreed that this element
of Rule 11 was not raised by this Advertisement. Accordingly she
ruled the Advertisement met the requirements of Rule 11 was not in
breach of it.</p>
<p>The Acting Chairperson took into account the Complainant’s concerns,
however, she was of the view, that <strong>as the Prime Minister and
leader of Labour Party, the public profile of the Rt Hon Helen
Clark, across a wide range of media, was such that the general
public would be familiar with her appearance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there's a fair case to be made that this complaint has a degree
of sexism and well as ageism to it, I find it hard (not impossible) to
imagine the same 'people wouldn't vote her if they knew she was ooolldd'
being levelled against a male&nbsp;politician? Comparing a politician's&nbsp;image
to a rusty car seems an especially thin point - when you buy a car, you
buy the car, when you vote a politicians you're not 'buying' their body.
Years later,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10824495">someone made a similar complaint to the UN ethics
office</a>&nbsp;about
a picture of her on a UN website and there's a definite&nbsp;ugliness&nbsp;about
this kind of complaint.&nbsp;We laugh about the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/jan/07/david-cameron-campaign-poster-rumour">Cameron
poster</a>,
but don't say it calls into question his fundamental character.</p>
<p>On the other hand, isn't it quite nice that even
this&nbsp;frivolous&nbsp;complaint was taken seriously and given (and as
the&nbsp;complainant&nbsp;says, prompt) consideration?</p>
<p>* This relates to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/show/2752">a
decision</a> by the NZ BSA
that a broadcast that declared&nbsp;an interview used an actor's voice, but
didn't declare the silhouetted&nbsp;figure was itself an actor was in breach
of accuracy rules.</p>

					<p>Yesterday's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism
Project</a>&nbsp;column introduced the
internet to what is highly likely to be a new urban legend: Slut
dropping. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">The full story
goes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
He described a group of excited male first-years who told him about
a new trend: “slut dropping”. The process, they explained, involves
driving around town with friends in the early hours of the morning
and offering a lift home to a young woman they deem a “slut”
(usually a woman in a “post-club state”). After asking her address,
they drive as fast and as far as possible in the opposite direction
before forcing the woman out of the car and using a camera to film
her “standing by the side of the road as they drive away”.&nbsp; Some of
the images find their way onto the internet, part of a disturbing
new trend of ‘slut-shaming’. On one occasion, the first-year added,
it had taken the girl eight hours to get home. When asked how he
knew, he explained that they were ‘friends’ on Facebook.</blockquote>
<p>There are obvious reasons to be suspicious of this: it's incredibly
elaborate and our source is 'people who our source talked to who heard
it off someone on facebook'. All urban legends seem to happen at that
friend of friend remove, both&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;and distant. Another interesting
aspect is &nbsp;'offering a lift home' because the story now involves the
woman making a choice. Urban legends are the oldest form of education -
telling you what choices and decisions are good or bad. This&nbsp;is why
urban legends are often structured exactly like horror stories, with
shared origins in scary stories told to teach the young lessons. &nbsp;It's
not enough that horrible things happen to you, you have to have made
choices that lead to this - as Cabin in the Woods put it&nbsp;&quot;if they don’t
transgress, they can’t be punished”.</p>
<p>Brunvard argues that urban legends &quot;often&nbsp;depict&nbsp;a clash between modern
conditions and some aspect of a traditional life-style&quot;[1. Brunvard, Jan
Harold (1981), The Vanishing Hitchhiker, New York: Norton, p. 18&nbsp;] and
here the conflict is with the idea of the modern, sexually liberated
woman. In this case the woman has committed three sins, looking like a
&quot;slut&quot;, walking home alone in the early hours and accepting a lift in a
stranger's car.&nbsp;That an urban legend obeys the rule of three isn't a
huge surprise - it's a storytelling rule for a reason, and urban legends
like all good memes will mutate till they find their most
attractive-to-spread form. We're invited to feel disgust that there are
people out there who would do this, which&nbsp;fascinatingly&nbsp;is the emotion
the most successful urban legends will pull on.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Heath_Emotional_Selection.pdf">Heath, Bell and
Sternberg
argue</a>&nbsp;(p
32)&nbsp;that urban legends aren't just selected on&nbsp;informational &nbsp;content,
but emotional content and will mutate to their most disgusting form:</p>
<blockquote>
In general, the studies provide converging evidence for emotional
selection. Study 1 showed that, controlling for informational
aspects of truth and usefulness, people were more willing to pass
along stories that elicited stronger disgust. Study 2 manipulated
levels of disgust, and showed that people preferred to pass along
the versions that produced the highest level of disgust. Study 3
showed that legends could be reliably coded for individual story
motifs that produce disgust (e.g., ingestion of a contaminated
substance). It also showed that the number of motifs affected
popularity; legends that contained more disgust motifs were more
likely to be passed along and were distributed more widely on web
sites that specialize in contemporary legends. The results of Study
3 are particularly interesting because they suggest that emotional
selection may alter the distribution of memes in the social
environment.</blockquote>
<p>There are clues as to what earlier versions of this legend may have
looked like: they don't just drop women off in the middle of nowhere -
they take pictures, they put it on&nbsp;Facebook! And what happens next? The
story spreads - look at the words used to describe 'slut dropping' in
follow-ups:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/09/slut-dropping-becomes-dis_n_1952553.html">Huffington Post
headline</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;'Slut Dropping' Becomes Disturbing Trend In England&quot;</blockquote>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://jezebel.com/5950287/slut+dropping-and-other-ways-college-teaches-kids-to-be-sexist-assholes">Jezebel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Today, let me introduce you to a practice known as &quot;slut-dropping.&quot;
Apparently it's all the rage in the UK, and I'm shocked that it
hasn't caught on Stateside, since this sounds right up a lot of
jerks' alleys.</blockquote>
<p>Here the meme has mutated again - it's not just a single
horrible&nbsp;incident, it's a trend, it has a <em>name</em>, it's happening
everywhere! We're no longer at the mercy of a depraved few, but exist in
a depraved society where this happens all the time. I don't know about
you, but that sounds pretty disgusting and spreadable.</p>
<p>Throughout this post I've been pretty dismissive of the idea that this
is a real thing because it has so many traits of an urban legend that
it'd be a surprise if it wasn't - there is of course
the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;that this happened somewhere at least once and mutated
into the legend it has now become. However as described 'slut dropping'
pretty much amounts to abduction and police records in the area in
question (where is that again?) could be a help for those looking to
confirm the story (though of course lack of records doesn't necessarily
disprove it) - it'll be interesting to see if anyone comes up with
anything.</p>
<p>As urban legends are always mutating to get around your defences and
spread themselves it's hard to blame anyone too much for giving this one
a kickstart but as&nbsp;Bates put that story quite early on, that's where a
lot of the attention is while the general point and the other examples
given are really worthy of a bit more attention. Go read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/slut-dropping-and-pimps-and-hoes--the-sexual-politics-of-freshers-week-8203400.html">the rest of
that
article</a>
again, we don't need&nbsp;mythical&nbsp;cars dropping women off in the middle of
nowhere for a lot to be wrong here.</p>

					<p>Yesterday George&nbsp;Osborne&nbsp;floated proposals that employers could offer
contracts that exchange '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/9593955/George-Osborne-workers-of-the-world-unite...and-give-up-your-employment-rights.html">workplace rights for tax-free shares in the
company</a>'.
While on the surface, this is trading hard-won employment rights for
magic beans that may or may not be worth much (and in many businesses'
cases, a wily employer could make it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/10/the-fundamental-problem-with-osbornes-employee-ownership-plan">worth very little
indeed</a>)
that's no reason to be harsh on the principle which could be used for
any number of things - what are other rights worth?</p>
<p>Have a look through the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art15">European Convention on Human
Rights</a> and ask
yourself, am I really ever going to use that?&nbsp;Take the prohibition in
Article 2 against the death penalty, even when we had it in the 20th
century we only executed around <a class="reference external" href="http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/hanging1.html#stats">11 people a
year</a>. Using
the 1900 population stats (which only increase and so make this even
more favourable) and assuming a life span of 80, I only have a&nbsp;0.002%
chance* of being&nbsp;executed in my lifetime &nbsp;- &nbsp;might I not be happy to
take few quid a year to waive&nbsp;my right not be executed?</p>
<p>Of course, no one is going to offer me money to waive that right&nbsp;for
exactly the same reason it might be appealing, &nbsp;it's not worth much to
me because the chances of execution are low and it's not worth much to
other people because the number of people wanting to execute me is also
low (hopefully). &nbsp;In the case for employment rights for shares, the
reasoning is that&nbsp;these are rights that people are quite likely to
exercise, but actually things would be better if they didn't.&nbsp;The ideal
situation for everyone is one where the right is worth very little to me
but quite a lot to someone else and there's an obvious candidate for
this - voting rights.</p>
<p>It's a famous problem for rational choice explanations of voting
behaviour&nbsp;that the benefit to the individual of voting is tiny compared
even to the very cheap costs of voting as the chances that your vote is
the one that changes the outcome is so tiny that taking it seriously is
like planning a route to work that avoids lottery-funded asteroid
strikes**. For those of us voting in safe seats we can be pretty
confident that our vote is almost entirely useless. &nbsp;The fact that
turnout still tends to be much higher than the 0% it should be is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_voting">Downs
Paradox</a>, and most
ways of resolving it rely on people voting on matters other than
self-interest, such as loyalty to the group or candidate, or even just
people think that voting is a Good Thing that should be encouraged and
gone through, even if the benefits to yourself are limited.</p>
<p>But what if we made it even more expensive to vote (or vote freely) by
offering money the other way?&nbsp;When <a class="reference external" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172644/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/11/14/News/Most-Say.Their.Vote.Has.A.Price-3099547.shtml">a class of NYU students was polled
in
2007</a>,
two-thirds would exchange their vote for a free year of&nbsp;tuition, half
for a million dollars and&nbsp;&nbsp;20% were as cheap as an iPod Touch (then
between $300-400).&nbsp;This isn't just good for candidates and my wallet,
a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pedrovicente.org/banho.pdf">study looking at São Tomé and
Príncipe</a>&nbsp;found that
decreasing vote-buying also hurt voter turnout and
increased&nbsp;incumbent&nbsp;advantage - which are bad things!</p>
<p>There may of course be downsides I'm missing to this, but while we're
working out which-rights-are-worth-how-much it's definitely something to
think about.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>*&nbsp;This is about the same odds as getting a straight flush in poker.
Here's the question, did me telling you that make you feel being
executed is more or less&nbsp;likely?&nbsp;Straight flushes are possible, your
chances of seeing one in every game you've ever played or seen are much
higher than the chances of getting one in your first game ever (which as
my odds were over a lifetime is equivalent). Likewise dramatic hands are
more likely to appear <a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicPokerEquation">in film or TV
depictions</a>.
This is a problem because when I give an example of&nbsp;probability&nbsp;your
brain does a trick where instead of working on the odds, it <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100184181/why-we-need-to-teach-parents-about-risk-and-statistics-in-the-wake-of-the-april-jones-horror/">tries to
think of an example of the thing
being&nbsp;described</a>
to assess the likelihood of it happening. Hence me giving the example of
a straight flush makes 0.002% seem far, far more&nbsp;likely&nbsp;than it actually
is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically we're terrible with risk.</p>
<p>** Note: may actually be more likely than that.</p>

					<p>(Spoilers, spoilers, this post contains spoilers).</p>
<p>Some quick assorted Dark Knight Rises thoughts. &nbsp;Looking back at some of
my previous posts like this, my usual opening writing tic is 'I liked
this film, but here's some things that were funny' - so in keeping with
that tradition I liked this film, but here's some things that were
funny.</p>
<div class="section" id="people-of-gotham">
<h2>People of Gotham</h2>
<p>I think the biggest critique possible of the film is that its most
thematically rich arena is the one most underused - the siege. &nbsp;To begin
with it's&nbsp;not clear why it's happening at all - the ticking timebomb
lends urgency to the final sequence, but why on earth is there that five
month delay? The real reason is that Bruce must be given realistic time
to overcome his physical and spiritual injuries and return to save the
day, but what’s the in-story explanation?</p>
<p>The obvious candidate is giving Gotham the chance to demonstrate it
doesn’t deserve to be saved (a reprise of the boats from the previous
film) - but this is undercut by the very little we see of Gotham’s
citizenry. It’s never really clear how much of Bane’s mob at the end is
imported or was recruited during the siege (it is implied that all along
it’s been fed by the unseen problems of the city though - ‘jobs in the
tunnels’ and all). We only have one character that buys into the
revolution and that’s Selina Kyle’s sidekick, the closest we have to a
class warrior is Selina Kyle herself, who quickly becomes disillusioned
at the results of Bane’s world (could be some fun identity stuff in
here, what’s a thief in a world without property?). Bane makes his deals
with capitalists to move the pieces into place, but where’s his similar
co-option of revolutionaries?</p>
<p>I am of course committing the classic critic mistake of demanding the
film-maker make a completely different film than the one they chose to
and it’s to the credit of the world building that you could fit a whole
mini-series (one I’d love to see) in what takes place over 15 minutes or
so - but as is, it’s hard to work out what Nolan’s actual take is here.
It’s clear that Bane isn't really in the revolution game and he's using
class conflict as the frayed thread that can be pulled to tear Gotham
apart (he’s almost mocking in handing Gotham ‘back to the people’) but
the film never really resolves if Gotham is in revolution or under
occupation - and there’s a thematic muddle as a result. How does the
film feel about Occupy? The trials for the wealthy? Is this about how
revolutions can go wrong? It might be, but we lack revolutionaries and
the only voices we hear are the ones we know to be disingenuous. Rise,
as the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Want-to-Be-a-Part-of-the-Dark-Knight-Rises-Soundtrack-133435573.html">crowd-sourced
chorus</a>&nbsp;repeatedly
demands, but this isn’t a call to revolution, it's asking a great man to
appear - for an individual to climb out of the pit. The people will ask
for heroes, but they stay off the stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-rise-of-robin">
<h2>The Rise of Robin</h2>
<p>Another way to look at the whole film is as a backstory for Robin (John
Blake, rhymes with Tim Drake - hey!) - what led this young police
officer to throw away his badge and take up the cape and cowl? Heroes in
this mold are are faced on both sides by agents of order and agents of
chaos and it’s the reasons they reject both that define them as
characters - Why doesn’t Bruce just join the police, why is Buffy
ill-suited for the Initiative?</p>
<p>In this light it’s worth looking at just how little John gets
accomplished in this film. Finds Commissioner Gordon, cool, realises the
masterplan to trap all the police underground (a plan that involves the
police suddenly reversing their previous strategy at the exact same time
as the football game, but anyway), cool but too late to do anything.
Tries to break out the underground cops, that didn’t work out, captured
and then freed by Batman who breaks them out more successfully - that’s
ok because he has a new mission leading an exodus over the bridge, but
that doesn’t work out either. I don’t think it’s inherently a bad thing
that one of our main characters spends so much time running around not
accomplishing anything because viewed right that’s part of his
disenchantment. We see the final straw when the rigidity of the police
following orders on the other side dooms the bus full of orphans to
oblivion, but what happened to Blake in the Gotham anarchy that led to
that moment? Again, that would have made an interesting story - but
would have been at the expense of the one that was actually told.</p>

<h2>Loose thoughts</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Object that has been most unnecessarily shaped into a bat: darts.
That has to make them less&nbsp;aerodynamic.</li>

a few years ago on Gotham as anarchy and Batman relationship with its
institutions to describe different schools of realism, Joker section
is a bit forced but the rest still vaguely holds.</li>
<li>I swear there’s a line from Catwoman that’s lifted from the Halle
Berry movie, which I’m assuming is a little in-joke, or I made it up.</li>
<li>Also: does she, or anyone else, ever refer to her as Catwoman?</li>
<li>Speaking of in-jokes: killer crocs!</li>
<li>“Some days you just can’t get rid of a bomb!”</li>
<li>Be interesting if there's ever an extended cut - I'm generally of the
opinion the shorter cut is always the better film, but i'm curious to
know what was left on the cutting room floor.</li>
<li>Did his name have to literally be 'Robin'? It was pretty obvious what
was going on there even without that.</li>
<li>Cheap energy that dooms us all is starting to be a bit of a recurring
theme in superhero films: this, Spiderman II, Avengers, any others?</li>
<li>You know if they took down some of those doors, they could probably

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/libdems/4519924649/"><img alt="Election 2010 Day 9 - Nick Clegg &amp; Vince Cable Launch the 2010 Liberal Democrat Manifesto" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4007/4519924649_86f3dc20ee_n.jpg" /></a>In the Lords report on the Lords Reform Bill
there's some <a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#a60">interesting
discussion</a>
of if a referendum is required or&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;before reform can proceed.</p>
<p>Alongside the standard argument that major constitutional change should
require a referendum is the idea that as all three major parties entered
into the last election with a manifesto commitment&nbsp;to Lords reform, no
party has a mandate to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;Lords reform. This is on the face of
it, puzzling - if a policy is so popular that all parties feel
it&nbsp;advantageous&nbsp;to put in their&nbsp;manifesto how can whatever government
results not have a mandate as a result? Here's what was said (or
summarized at the end if you want to skip):</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="373">
<li>...The Government's view is that:</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;because all three parties were in favour of this, we did not think
that a referendum was justified. When the House of Lords
Constitution Committee looked at referendums, it said that it
thought that abolition of the House of Lords would be a subject on
which you would automatically want to have a referendum, but it did
not say that changing the composition of the House of Lords would be
such a proposition. So, no, we do not think that a referendum is
necessary, and that is why we did not propose it in our draft Bill
or White
Paper&quot;.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note438">438</a>]</p>
<p>373. Despite the constitutional importance of the subject, the lack
of a clear party division on the issue means that any opposition to
the proposed reform cannot readily be tested at any future election
by voting for one or other candidates seeking election to the House
of Commons. If the Government has its way, the draft Bill will have
become an Act before the next general election, at which the first
tranche of elected Members of a reformed House of Lords would be
seeking election. There is thus no opportunity for the electorate to
provide a mandate for these
proposals.[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201012/jtselect/jtdraftref/284/28407.htm#note439">439</a>]</p>
<p>374. Mr Christopher Hartigan, who described himself as &quot;a member of
the public with an interest in constitutional matters and Lords
Reform in particular&quot; put it:</p>
<p>The fact that elections were mentioned in the three manifestoes does
not mean it is the settled view of a party, it is not, or the
majority of members of a party agree with it or that the electorate
want it either. It can be said that the fact that it was in three
manifestos makes it clear that the people had no choice. It should
also be remembered all three parties LOST the election. ... If the
government believe this is the will of the people then it should
proceed on a free vote of their representatives or hold a
constitutional referendum before such important changes are made.</p>
<p>377. Professor Vernon Bogdanor told us in oral evidence that a
referendum would be the right way forward because all three parties
proposed an elected Lords in their election manifestos in 2010, so
there was no way for the voter to indicate his or her opinion: &quot;I
think it would be right to hold a referendum on this issue, which I
think is a greater change than the alternative vote system that has
been rejected&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The substantial argument here is that&nbsp;politically popular is not the
same as popularly popular, the policy&nbsp;could in fact be a stitch-up among
the political class to deny choice on a certain issue while
the&nbsp;truly&nbsp;popular policy goes unexpressed.&nbsp;The point about mandates is
that they result from the public having made a set of choices of Party A
over Party B, if there was no&nbsp;differentiation, there was no choice to be
made, thus no mandate.</p>
<p>This makes the maths of mandates somewhat counter-intuitive. If we
imagine rival parties A and B and the mandate for policy X, we end up
with this strange table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="25%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td><strong>Party A</strong></td>
<td><strong>Party B</strong></td>
<td><strong>Mandate</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>A has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Y</td>
<td>Y</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>X</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>No party has mandate for X</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If no party is in support, there is no mandate for X, if every party is
in support, there is no mandate for X.&nbsp;If we take the idea of mandates
seriously for a minute this means if&nbsp;the other side steals your good
idea, then suddenly they've taken away your mandate to implement it.
Does that mean that policy X should be put to a referendum to gain its
mandate? Or if arguing that that's reserved for constitutional issues
(which X may not be),&nbsp;does it mean the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Convention">Salisbury
doctrine</a> (<a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/2011/07/04/salisbury-lords-reform-history/">if it
still
exists</a>)
shouldn't apply because X doesn't really have a mandate from the nation?</p>
<p>Added to that is a question of how different policies X and Y need to be
before the public can be said to have offered&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;choice. While
all three&nbsp;manifestos pledged to reform the House of Lords, Labour
differed in requiring a referendum, the Conservatives only committed to
a 'mainly-elected' chamber - are those differentiation enough that
voters had a choice?&nbsp;Labour wanted open-list PR, if the Lib Dems had put
their preference for STV into the manifesto would that have been making
a choice?</p>
<p>In this case the argument is limited to saying that an issue that would
otherwise require a referendum can go without if the election was fought
out on a very specific set of circumstances, but the general principle
is worth thinking about&nbsp;as&nbsp;there are any number of areas where overlap
between the parties is large. &nbsp;The argument is that certain manifesto
combinations shouldn't be given practical&nbsp;significance, but the
fiddlyness of the situation that results seems to argue pretty well that
manifesto&nbsp;commitments&nbsp;shouldn't have practical&nbsp;significance full stop.</p>
<p>This ultimately comes down to the old question of what exactly happens
in an election - are we empowering people to decide or people to
deliver? At various times manifestos were certainly viewed as binding -
Stanley Baldwin claimed the 1923 election was held solely to reverse a
manifesto&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;of his&nbsp;predecessor[1. Dennis Kavangh, '<a class="reference external" href="http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXXIV/1/7.extract">The
Politics of
Manifestos</a>',&nbsp;Parliamentary&nbsp;Affairs,
34(1),1981 ,p.8] - but Kavanagh argues that this becomes
increasingly&nbsp;untenable&nbsp;in the modern age:</p>
<blockquote>
Instead of the mandate referring to a major issue, governments now
use the term to justify a battery of items in the manifesto, however
picayune they may be. As pledges are fulfilled, so the government
spokesman claims that he has kept faith with the electorate,
regardless of the popularity of the measure. But it is the sheer
number of proposals in modern manifestos which weakens the notion of
the mandate as the conscious support of each manifesto proposal by a
person who votes for the party. It is because voters for a party
simply cannot be expected to be aware of all of the proposals, let
alone agree with them, that Finer makes the charge of &quot;manifesto
moonshine &quot; [2. Ibid. p. 9]</blockquote>
<p>This raises the obvious&nbsp;complaint&nbsp;about the idea of mandates: when
voters enter the voting booth are they really endorsing the&nbsp;entirety&nbsp;of
that party's manifesto? Might their decision perhaps be&nbsp;influenced&nbsp;by
other considerations? Can a party really claim a mandate from the nation
for a vague&nbsp;commitment&nbsp;hidden in a footnote on page five underneath the
'beware of the leopard' sign?</p>
<p>I think it'd be fair to say that today (ignoring fiddly issues such as
the position of coalition agreements) while 'mandate' is thrown around
as a useful bit of&nbsp;language, the predominate mindset is that
governments&nbsp;can do anything they can practically achieve and
that&nbsp;manifestos only have practical, as opposed to political,
significant in odd (and probably doomed) cases like the Salisbury
doctrine - on the basis of the above it's hard to say there's much wrong
with this.</p>
<p>I remain a bit unsure if the&nbsp;cancelling&nbsp;maths of mandates is something
that should be taken seriously but given both accepting it and rejecting
it stress the idea of manifesto mandates to breaking point it does
illustrate the underlying concept is a bit fragile and shouldn't be too
heavily relied on.&nbsp;For Lords reform,&nbsp;this means that if a referendum is
needed (and I think would be the last chance for groups like Unlock
Democracy to establish <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/blog/entry/the-public-should-have-the-power-to-veto-elected-lords-not-another-vanity-r">an alternative
principle</a>),
a referendum is needed - and that in general we should shy away from
arrangements that give much practical importance to manifesto promises
(while of course being free to politically punish parties for breaking
them).</p>

                </h2>
				Jun 21, 2012
                
				
					<p>The goal with this post was to see if I&nbsp;could come up in a morning with
a quick method to test the 'politicalness' of eurovision voting. &nbsp;To
keep it simple I assumed that most 'political' voting was related to
cultural factors that would map onto geographical proximity and so the
question became 'Would countries give higher points to countries closer
to them than those further away'?&nbsp;Using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/Eurovision2010">this
dataset</a> of all results from
1998-2009 and the results from the Wikipedia pages for
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2010">2010</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2011">2011</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2012">2012</a>, I
created a single dataset of all votes cast since 1998. Then I made a
list for each eurovision country of all other eurovision countries they
shared a border with. For countries bordering seas, I counted all
countries with reasonable straight lines across the water (erring on the
side of being over generous). From this I created a new variable
representing the degrees of separation between the source and
destination of all votes (where 1 means they share a border, 2 means
there’s one country in the middle and so on). This dataset is
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjeRO7qR270JdFhxSHU3ZVBNSG1MTXQ5aHZhZkhZamc#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>A robust regression shows that there is a statistically significant
relationship at the 1% level where each less degree of separation
between A and B increases the number of points transferred from A to B
by 0.39(±0.068). The exact coefficient varies year on year and the
relationship drops from significance in 1998 and 2001. As the first few
‘hops’ are likely to be the most important (it’s doubtful the hop from 4
to 5 degrees of separation is a serious consideration for anyone), it’s
worth re-running the regression looking only at if countries share a
border or not. From this we get another significant relationship where a
country will give around 1.9(±0.245) more points to countries it shares
a border with than those it won’t.</p>
<p>While it's nice to have a number on this we’re only explaining a few
percent of the overall vote transfer (2.6% when using all degrees
of&nbsp;separation&nbsp;and 4.6% when only using border/noborder) and it’s not at
all clear that ‘degrees of separation' &nbsp;are the best measurement of
geographic effects. Would the effect be larger or smaller if I was less
generous with borders over seas? Should we be looking at ‘regions’,
countries that share a language? This analysis used all votes cast, but
not all countries are regular players - the relationship might be
different if it was cut down to those who vote every time.</p>
<p>At this point rather than plough on, &nbsp;I decided to look up if anyone had
ever done any proper work on&nbsp;eurovision and found that of course they
have and a great common thread in these is some kind of justification
for having bothered to study something like Eurovision in the first
place.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>
is arguing Eurovision can be used to create a cultural structural
analysis of the post iron-curtain Europe and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn et
al</a> that the
&quot;Eurovision&nbsp;network&nbsp;is analogous to a range of other complex dynamic
networks involving&nbsp;the&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;of goods and opinions&quot;...which are
clearly just excuses.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505071">Fenn, Suleman, Efstathiou and
Johnson</a> (2006) looked at
Eurovision as a network in terms of &nbsp;how in sync countries are with each
other i.e. how similarly are their votes distributed when you ignore
their votes towards each other. They found that the UK was actually the
most 'in sync' with&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;in general between 1992 and 2003 and while
there were patterns that vindicated my geographical links such&nbsp;Estonia
being associated with the Nordic countries, others raise serious
problems with it such as Spain being absent from the group that includes
France and&nbsp;Portugal.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/03788733/1995/00000017/00000002/art00253">Yair</a>(1995
- so an older study of a very different eurovision) similarly look at
network effects breaks down eurovision countries into &quot;five meaningful
cliques&quot;, which are further combined into Western, Northern and
Mediterranean blocs (where the last feels like a 'and the rest' bloc)
and that the then supremacy of countries in the Western Bloc was a
result of three of the most&nbsp;strongly&nbsp;knit cliques are located within it.
&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=884379">Ginsburgh and
Noury</a>(2004)
is the closest to a more developed version of my attempt, looking at the
effect of cultural and linguistic proximity (which geographic proximity
would at best be acting as a proxy for) on points and finding that a)
these are important factors that far exceed the effects of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> and b) that the
'quality' of the song tends to have quite a large effect on the results.</p>
<p>So in a most boring answer, Eurovision turns out to be actually about
the music. But that's the numbers for you.</p>
