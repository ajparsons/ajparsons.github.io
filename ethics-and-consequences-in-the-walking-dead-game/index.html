					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/TWD-game-cover-286x300.jpg" />I've been a fan of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.telltalegames.com/">Telltale</a> since the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4Lw312RrXk">Sam &amp;
Max</a> games and in recent
games started to notice a trend towards games that had some
consideration of ethical issues. In their <em>Jurassic Park</em> game
characters have a lengthy debate about the morality of the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Lysine_contingency">lysine
contingency</a>,
and in their <em>Back to the Future</em> game a version of Emmett Brown
pointedly asks what gives you (Marty) the right to use time travel to
decide which people should and shouldn't be living happy lives in 1985.
While I ended up being disappointed by the game&nbsp;ending in both cases, I
was impressed at how Telltale had found ways to mine&nbsp;the world of
the&nbsp;franchises they're playing in&nbsp;and ask interesting ethical questions
about them. While the show version of <em>The Walking Dead</em> has issues, I
was interested to see what Telltale would do with a world that was
essentially always about making difficult ethical choices.</p>
<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> game exists in roughly the same world as the comics
and TV show&nbsp;(not aware if it's considered in the same canon as either,
although there is some character overlap) where the world is overrun by
a zombie&nbsp;apocalypse and the driving narrative force is dealing with&nbsp;how
people exist with uncomfortable decisions and the end of
civilisation.&nbsp;Gameplay is relatively simple, the majority of the game is
spent going between cut-scenes and dialogue options, where&nbsp;your choices
of dialogue will affect your relationship with other characters,
affecting future dialogue.&nbsp;There are also scenes where there is freedom
to roam and accomplish traditional point-and-click game tasks, or&nbsp;action
sequences with Quick Time events.</p>
<p>At the start of each episode the game tells you: '<em>This game series
adapts to the choices you make. The story is tailored by how you play.'</em>
However what becomes apparent quite quickly is that your ability to make
choices that drastically affect the story is quite limited but what I
found especially interesting after playing the first few episodes was
how this made the game better at being an 'ethics game' than an
endlessly branching story might be.</p>
<p>To take a typical choice, there's a situation where you can choose to
act morally, but this will cause you to have less time to gather
supplies. However aside from some dialogue about this the supplies
themselves mean nothing, this isn't a game with health bars and you are
physically able to carry out the same tasks no matter how much your
character has eaten.&nbsp;Similarly a decision whether or not to take
supplies from a possible abandoned car doesn't matter, your group will
survive and be alive and well in the next episode anyway.</p>
<p>To an extent this is making lives easier for the developers who don't
have to track and script every possible divergent fork.&nbsp;Unlike some text
adventure games it won't severely punish you hours down the line from a
decision made early on (and most decisions that cause divergent paths
collapse to the same outcome, if through slightly different means), all
death events are caused by&nbsp;insufficient&nbsp;button mashing and there are
very few places where you can through dialogue choices lead to a 'game
over'. However, practical&nbsp;considerations&nbsp;aren't the only ones here and I
think the general inflexibility of the game world goes&nbsp;some way&nbsp;towards
making this an interestingly ethics-based game.</p>
<p>In trying to work out how to account for ethical choices in a game like
this I was reminded of a season two episode of <em>Angel</em> -
'<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(Angel)">Epiphany</a>'. In
this episode&nbsp;Angel, who had seen himself as a pivotal player in the
battle between good and evil, realises what a small player he really is
and decides that if the big ends are unchangeable then how he chooses to
act is the only thing that matters -&nbsp;&quot;If nothing we do matters, then all
that matters is what we do&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a credo that carries over well to The Walking Dead.&nbsp;Your
character simply does not have the power to influence the world around
him to huge degrees. We, as players, know that the world is on rails and
certain events are inevitable regardless of our choices but the
reactions of other characters are flexible enough to our choices that
there is a sense of immersion and weight to choices we make. &nbsp;The key
question here is if your character is powerless to prevent or control
his fate, does it make choosing to behave ethically more or less
meaningful?</p>
<p>My thinking is that this lack of control takes away a lot of traditional
gaming thinking from the player. If it was possible to prevent every
death, there'd be incentive for people to see each death as a failure
and constantly reload in search of that '100% complete' achievement (Ã 
la&nbsp;<em>Heavy Rain</em>).&nbsp;By keeping choices about choosing sides (and
aligning yourself with various other characters), the game sidesteps the
problem of creating right and wrong answers to puzzles - there are
simply choices you make. And if these choices have no effect on 'game
score' - then there is no disincentive to role play.</p>
<p>How do you decide which four out of ten people will get food?&nbsp;You can
play it by who you want to keep 'on side' but as established that
doesn't matter-matter &nbsp;- by taking away practical gaming considerations
the game makes you consider what you would do in those circumstances.
&nbsp;When the game offered me a choice of keeping the last piece of food for
myself, I&nbsp;was stuck on that decision for a minute or so - without
in-game&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;our own sense of ethics can be fully engaged.</p>
<p>However, the flip side is the question of can a game that doesn't make
you suffer for picking morally better
but&nbsp;practically&nbsp;disadvantageous&nbsp;decisions really be asking you to make
meaningful decisions?&nbsp;To which I'd answer that meaningful in the game
and meaningful to the player are quite different things.&nbsp;By turning off
gamer logic, the game changes the basis you make decisions on. You're
not choosing which version of the game you want to be playing an hour
down the line but are forced to make decisions based on personal
considerations.</p>
<p>So while <em>The Walking Dead</em> may in some senses be far more linear than
it's described as, the linear plot creates room for an interesting kind
of sandbox ethics game. Even if most choices don't matter to the story,
they do matter to you.</p>
