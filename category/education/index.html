post</a>
explored, my reading of the Browne report is that they found it's the
responsibility of the state to ensure a decent level of funding for
education but also that the government decision making process can't be
trusted to carry this out -&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;a system in which money is
compelled out of the government coffers as loans, with prices set
elsewhere. The Browne report redefines the role of the state so that
there is no splitting of the burden between public and private sources,
but the state simply&nbsp;provides&nbsp; the capital upfront to allow your future
private self to fund your education. In this way it changes government's
role from being the representation of the public interest to one where
it plays banker and is no longer required to make funding decisions.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this in a few courses that are deemed to require
continued public funding. While the courses listed are discussed only in
terms of economic worth, keeping any idea of a cultural benefit firmly
out of range, what the report’s actually getting at here isn’t just
which courses are and aren’t economically required but mostly that these
are courses that are more expensive to run, and so require subsidies to
hide the true cost from students who might be put off. This amounts to
an acknowledgement of the fairly obvious reality that students will be
put off from one course as opposed to another on the basis of price
(even when the cost isn't paid upfront) and concludes that the
intimidation of higher fees for economically vital professions is
considered serious enough that intervention is required. But to play the
free-market position for a moment (and indeed use the language used
elsewhere in the report), surely if these professions are truly vital,
their future employers will pay higher wages that justify the investment
they make in an education? If student choice has failed us here, are
there other instances we should correct for the market?</p>
<p>Interestingly this means the Browne report does have a notion of the
public good, but only in so far as we have enough engineers - there is
no such argument made, for instance, that there is a good in having our
elite institutions truly open to all. [1. I agree with Paul Sager that
if we’re looking at elite institutions as a way for the poor to leapfrog
into the higher echelons of society this <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2010/11/19/tuition-fees-social-justice-and-social-mobility/">isn’t the best conception of
the overall
problem</a>,
but that said a system in which the existing elite completely dominate
the institutions that perpetuate it is even more undesirable than one in
which that’s only partly true.] &nbsp;Browne at the same time as basing its
system around the idea of student (consumer) choice, keeps pulling back
from the idea that students are actually capable of making the correct
decisions – and to be honest they’re probably right to - it’s not at all
clear that even given ridiculous amounts of metrics prospective students
will be in any position to make educated choices, as laid out in Stefan
Collini’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n21/stefan-collini/brownes-gamble">excellent critique of
Browne</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Browne appears to believe that the only relevant measure of teaching
quality is ‘student satisfaction’. That is how the system will work:
if they are satisfied, they’ll pay, and if not, not; and the
pressure they exert thereby will ‘drive up quality’. But this, other
problems aside, comes perilously close to reducing important human
experiences to a set of ‘preferences’ as reported on a tick-box
questionnaire. I would hope the students I teach come away with
certain kinds of dissatisfaction (including with themselves: a
‘satisfied’ student is nigh-on ineducable), and it matters more that
they carry on wondering about the source of that dissatisfaction
than whether they ‘liked’ the course or not. This is another respect
in which the ‘consumer’ model is simply misleading, an error
encouraged by the prevalence in current edspeak of the category of
‘the student experience’ (many universities now have a senior figure
entitled Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Student Experience). It may be that
the most appropriate way to decide whether the atmosphere in the
student bar is right is by what students say when asked in a
questionnaire whether they ‘like’ it or not. But this is obviously
not the best way to decide whether a philosophy degree should have a
compulsory course on Kant. The philosophy department might hope
that, some time after graduation, most of its former students would
come to see the wisdom of this requirement, but ‘student
satisfaction’ is not what is at issue here. That this recognition is
retrospective tells us something important about education:
individuals often need to be told by someone who knows that a
particular line of study is worth pursuing whether at the time they
want to or not.</blockquote>
<p>While the report writers attempted to solve the perceived inability of
politicians to make the right call on education by turning that decision
over to a market, it’s not at all clear that the mechanism they picked
is appropriate to the task and the report itself doesn’t have a great
deal of trust in prospective students to make the right decisions when
it’s really important. The vaguely tragic thing about the Browne report
is that the version that arrived in the final coalition plan doesn’t
even seem to achieve its own ends. Its goal of separating education
funding from government oversight has failed as the caps mean that many
universities will raise their fees to the cap just to replace cuts and
so future governments will be required to either raise the cap or
increase public investment in order to inject more money into the
system. I don’t think it’s a universally terrible plan, the repayment
plan is genuinely more progressive but it’s not at all convincing that
the fees based market approach gives enough benefits to justify the

effects</a>
that putting the price upfront &nbsp;produces.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/59937401&#64;N07/5474761220/"><img alt="Money and Calculator" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5474761220_345e33882e.jpg" /></a><em>Note: I started writing this piece back in
January, the recent (and completely predictable) announcements that
everyone who can get away with it will be charging the maximum spurred
me to go back and finish it off.</em></p>
<p>I saw Aaron Porter on the 10 o’clock the other week (note: now many,
many months ago) criticising fees and loans on the basis that it will
put students into debt for decades, which coming from the NUS position
of a graduate tax is a little unfair as there is no practical difference
between repaying a loan for three decades and being subject to an
additional tax for the same amount of time (especially if both the tax
and repayments are structured in a progressive way). If we imagine a
situation where universities charged an infinite fee, an infinite loan
was given and repayments were structured progressively and had a sunset
after a few decades, there is no difference whatsoever in the effect on
the payee. There is however a psychological difference between a debt
with an exact price attached and a fuzzy commitment to higher taxes
that’s given too short a shrift in the report. Given the choice, giving
people good news (free university!) with hidden bad news (new higher
tax!) is better than giving bad news with hidden good news (Expensive
university! <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14111421">Which you might not have to pay all
of!</a> And the repayments
process is good! But the frogurt is also cursed etc) and efforts to
reassure people that university is actually pretty affordable have to
fight uphill against that basic gut reaction, no matter how nice the
numbers look.</p>
<p>Because of that problem you’d hope that fees-and-loans had some pretty
substantial advantages over a graduate tax, but the Report’s criticisms
of it are quite revealing of what it’s actually trying to do. There are
a few areas where fees-and-loans is cleaner than a graduate tax would be
e.g. a graduate tax has issues reclaiming money from graduates who move
abroad and in dealing with students who&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;complete their courses
(not deriving enough benefit from their courses to justify a tax but
still a drain on the education budget), but the big issue Browne finds
with it is that it’s economically&nbsp;unfeasible&nbsp;given that it won’t start
to produce enough money to fund itself until 2041. This nicely overlooks
that fees-and-loans also requires the government to borrow/spend a large
amount of money year on year to be able to give loans to students and
the average student won’t start come close to paying back the original
amount until around the same time period. &nbsp;[update: &nbsp;the difference here
is a quirk of government accounting where loans only need to be
accounted for at the rate of non-repayment (RAB rate) - the actual lost
money over the long term - whereas spending money resulting from a tax
requires the full education budget to fit on the government coffers].
&nbsp;In both systems investment is not paid back for around 30 years – and
in the meantime the money still has to come from somewhere. I think what
the report’s criticism of a graduate tax is really getting at is the
notion that runs right through the report that government has
historically failed to make the investments necessary and cannot be
trusted to provide the general investment or per student funding the
system needs.</p>
<p>As I read it, the unwritten purpose throughout the report is to
safeguard university funding from future government action under the
(perhaps not unreasonable) assumption this government or likely future
governments will not substantially increase the amount of money going
into education through the block grant to universities, especially under
the current austerity plans. It takes the approach of rather than
arguing for increased public investment in further education, assume
that that’s a lost cause and try to find ways to do it without
government needing to be involved. By transforming all government
spending on further education into a guarantee of providing loans and
letting universities set the fees (with no caps) this gives universities
a semi-blank check from the government coffers to invest in themselves.
This I suspect is the serious objection of the Browne Report to a
graduate tax, despite shifting the cost onto graduates as a group it
leaves the funding decisions to government. With Fees-and-Loans that
year on year spending is hidden and occurs automatically behind the
loans, no actual decision is required to fund it. it’s hard to see any
government challenging the idea of deferred payment and it’s far easier
for fees-and-loans to hide behind this than a graduate tax.</p>
<p>However the problem here is that giving universities a blank cheque is a
really bad idea because in the unlikely, “why would that ever happen?”
event that lots of universities change high fees (ironically as Stephen
Tall <a class="reference external" href="http://iaindale.com/posts/why-the-coalition-is-muddled-but-right-about-tuition-fees">points
out</a>,
this might not have happened without fee caps), the government is then
on the hook for more than it’s really able to be and we end up with the
situation where they’re desperately looking to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/node/18897863?story_id=18897863&amp;fsrc=rss">offload some of the debt
load onto the private
sector</a>.
As the next post will go into, at the same time as a market-based system
still runs into the money problem it’s also opened up a whole new can of
worms in terms of what a market in education is actually supposed to
function.</p>
