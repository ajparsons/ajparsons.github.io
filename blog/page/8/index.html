					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/447138298-300x161.jpg" />(This post contains spoilers. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.slashfilm.com/spoilers-good-study/">But spoilers are good for
you</a>.)</p>
<p>The first installement of Charlie Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/black-mirror/">Black
Mirror</a> is, if
nothing else, clever.&nbsp;The name of the anthology&nbsp;itself is clever, being
both the literal 'dark mirror' that looks back on us from any screen
that's turned off and the idea that technology has created a
metaphorical dark mirror of society where people are freed
to&nbsp;indulge&nbsp;their darker selves. &nbsp;Brooker clearly knows his stuff and the
film plays off media touch-stones like&nbsp;Gillian Duffy and
super-injunctions to the storming of Bin Laden's compound and the
Norway&nbsp;massacre.&nbsp;As a native to both old and new media he can skewer
both sharply, with eerily&nbsp;believable hashtags and barbs aimed at more
traditional outlets(&quot;The Guardian are running a fucking live blog, and a
short think piece on the historical symbolism of the pig&quot;)&nbsp;but these
understated enough to stay out of the foreground and form the absurd and
realistic backdrop to the drama.</p>
<p>I quite liked 'The National Anthem' and thought it did a lot of things
well but was a slightly different film to what it was billed as. A
common theme in pre-air write-ups was that the film would be
an&nbsp;indictment of the mob tendencies of Twitter (partly because that's
what Brooker himself kept claiming it was) which is odd really because
that was the weakest aspect of the film.&nbsp;Chris Applegate <a class="reference external" href="http://yfrog.com/nts1dawp">points
out</a> the idea for 'The National Anthem'
first came up in Brooker's <a class="reference external" href="http://images.thebookpeople.co.uk/images/products/insidelarge/1SYN_inside_l_5.pdf">Guardian Screen Burn
column</a>&nbsp;(
p191)&nbsp;in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Before the tragic death of England’s Rose (and that’s Princess Diana
I’m talking about, not Roy Kinnear), I’d had an idea for a short
story, which went something like this: two demented pranksters
kidnap the Princess of Hearts, then contact Scotland Yard anannounce
their ‘ransom’. She will be released unharmed, provided Terry Wogan
goes on live television and has full sexual intercourse with a sow.
The act must be broadcast in blistering close-up on all ﬁve
terrestrial channels, uninterrupted and entirely unexpurgated. Cue
plenty of soul-searching for Wogan as the deadline draws ever
nearer. Finally, after much pressure from the tabloids, he gives in.</p>
</div><div><p>The horrendous act is broadcast live, the Princess is released, and
the nation’s television is never quite the same again: the bar for
what’s acceptable onscreen has been raised to unthinkable levels;
Wogan’s career has been revitalised – the ratings were so good, he
repeats his performance on a weekly basis. At teatime. And
everyone’s happy.&nbsp;See, I’ve often thought that if something like
that were to actually&nbsp;happen, no one could ever complain about
programmes like Tipping the Velvet (BBC2) again.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<div><p>This is useful for examining 'The National Anthem' as the aims of the
film become more apparent by looking at how the story has evolved over
time. The most telling change is that he moved the debasement of
television from being the conclusion of the story to being the premise -
but rather than pig-related antics being the cause instead it was the
rise of social media and the ease of access to foreign news forcing
domestic news to lower their standards to compete.</p>
<p>In 'The National Anthem', the fictional news network UKN argues that if
they don't start covering the story they'll be proving that their model
of news is&nbsp;irrelevant in a world where people can get their news
uncensored and unrestricted from the internet, but it's actually in
covering the story that they demonstrate their&nbsp;irrelevance. Because
there were no more facts to be had all they could do is reproduce
Twitter in widescreen, producing exactly the same empty speculation and
vox-pops that people can do from their own homes.&nbsp;In a very nice touch,
the story they're running before they violate the D-Notice is&nbsp;about a
controversial artist whose exhibit at the Tate had to be closed early.
In the rush to put pointless talking heads on the screen (including an
actress from Downton Abbey and two people arguing if the pig aspect made
it more or less likely to be Islamic terrorism), they take the report
that tells the Who and Where off-air.</p>
<p>UKN going for broke and airing the second video is scarily believable
once the idea that anything 'out there' is fair game is taken seriously
(real world example, I have trouble believing that if the&nbsp;picture of
Gaddafi's body was taken by a BBC photographer rather than being 'out
there' it would have been&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2011/10/the_challenges_of_reporting_ga.html">used on the BBC
website</a>).&nbsp;The
newsroom's belief that it was 'out there' and so their coverage couldn't
have any more negative effect shows they underestimate their own
significance. While they were observing the D-Notice characters wondered
if it was all hoax, showing&nbsp;that their&nbsp;silence retained power - without
the media to provide a common space it's doubtful the idea that a
majority supported giving in to the demand would have gained much
purchase. But UKN in an attempt to prove their&nbsp;relevance and power
instead ended up giving it to the mob.</p>
</div><div><p>That Wogan is replaced by the Prime Minister and the tabloids by Twitter
gives us the second thread of the story, promising to combine
focus-group led politicians with the electronic mob in a terrifying
combination. As Brooker said in the Radio Times <a class="reference external" href="http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2011-12-04/charlie-brooker-on-black-mirror,-twitter-and-the-media">in promotion of Black
Mirror</a>:</p>

    <div>

 The tabloids used to be adept at whipping the public into an
 infuriated frenzy: now we do it to ourselves. The results can be
 startling. An outbreak of Twitter rage helped finish off the News of
 the World as users bombarded advertisers to demand they take a
 stand. Many would view that as positive (and fitting, given the
 paper’s history of playing to the mob).

    <div>

 But consider the case of Rebecca Black, the 13-year-old who recorded
 an admittedly terrible pop song called Friday and found herself
 fending off thousands of abusive messages, chiefly from other
 youngsters trying to out-do each others’ viciousness by hurling
 missives such as “I hope you die of anorexia” at her personal
 account.

    <div>

 The media has already started using Twitter as a kind of unofficial
 focus group; entertainment producers can monitor the reaction to
 their shows and tweak them accordingly. News organisations use it to
 publicise stories and gauge public interest. It’s only a matter of
 time before politicians start pandering to the online hivemind too –
 and failing. This is what the first episode of my new series, Black
 Mirror, is about.

 .. raw:: html

    </div><div><p>But I found this aspect to be the less cohesive part of the story. While
Twitter played a big role in the news focused part of the story, it
diminished in the second half and the actual mob was left to be
demonstrated by pie charts on the tv rather than twitter flash-mobs,
mass e-mailings of Downing Street or the like. The factors that changed
peoples mind were again presented to the audience entirely through the
conventions of TV news.&nbsp;A&nbsp;longer&nbsp;stretch&nbsp;of narrative time might have
solved this, the original story sounds like it may have taken place over
days and that might have given space for the mob aspect to evolve in
ways that didn't rely on media shorthand. In fairness there's only so
much you can do in the running time(and empty streets are much cheaper
than mob&nbsp;scenes) but the ultimate weakness of the mob angle is shown in
the scene where Callow is convinced to go through with it:</p>

<div><p>What ultimately convinces Callow isn't the polling, but the threat to
his family. While the threat of mob violence is used as a pretext, what
that actually comes off as is a threat from the establishment.&nbsp;The old
media controls have failed, technology failed to provide a solution and
so the&nbsp;old power, not the new, asserts itself in the oldest way with the
threat of violence.&nbsp;In this sense it's a&nbsp;film about the broken glass,
not the monsters that lurk on the other side. This is perfectly fine
subject matter and it still has a point to make, but it's not quite the
film Brooker seems to be suggesting it is in the Radio Times piece
above.</p>
<p>Brooker's work tends not to be able to stay serious for too long without
trying to puncture that seriousness and given 'The National Anthem'
certainly takes itself and its premise seriously, I quite liked the
hidden attempt to burst its own bubble in the epilogue. I read the idea
that the affair was considered by some to be 'the first great work of
art of the 21st century' as a comment on the film itself ('Carlton
Bloom' shares Brooker's initials and 'Charlton' is the name he uses by
on Twitter), self-deprecatingly&nbsp;criticising the idea that the film
itself had any artistic merit and asking &quot;Sure some people may say I've
made a brilliant film showcasing the dark path our media has taken, but
are you sure I didn't just make a film where a man had sex with a pig?&quot;</p>
<p>You pay the licence fee, you decide.</p>

                </h2>
				Nov 23, 2011
                
				
					<p>The idea of the 'human mic' was one born out of a practical necessity,
the police prevented the first OWS protests from
having&nbsp;electronic&nbsp;amplification so to compensate the mechanism of the HM
emerged, where the person currently with the 'mic' would say a short
phrase of their statement, which those around them would shout, before
the speaker moved onto the next phase and so on - there's a good example
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIK7uxBSAS0">here</a>:</p>
<p>In addition to solving the initial&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;problem Mark Lance and
Sydney Levy at the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html">New APPS
blog</a>&nbsp;point
out&nbsp;that this has some quite interesting effects on the nature of
discourse through the HMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is most interesting about the HM is the way that it shapes the
time and space of a discourse. &nbsp;Of course the most obvious feature
is that it slows things down. &nbsp;Everything is said twice. &nbsp;This is a
mixed blessing, no doubt, stretching out already long consensus
meetings. &nbsp;But at the same time, we must remember that we are
dealing with a huge, diverse crowd of people, many of whom are
completely new to the very idea of directly democratic
decision-making, and none of whom have much experience with this
group. &nbsp;So slowing things down and repeating everything that is said
before it is possible to respond also functions to draw people in
and lends an air of seriousness to the comments of others.</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice eliminates side-conversations. &nbsp;If you
participate in the HM, you have to listen so that you can repeat.
&nbsp;You can't be chatting snarkily with your neighbor, or even focusing
on a text. &nbsp;Neither can folks talk over one another as they could
if, say, everyone was mic-ed electronically. &nbsp;The HM can only repeat
one thing at a time. &nbsp;So there is a built in technological
imperative of waiting one's turn.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>HM as a practice seems to function to &quot;decenter&quot; conversation in
large groups. &nbsp;You don't have to be on the stage, at the mic, or in
front to be a part of the conversation of the whole. &nbsp;And even in
the most inclusive groups, the process of coming up to the front
will be disproportionate intimidating to some and, &nbsp;in the case of
some disabilities, physically difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HMs on the face of it seems to address the classic problem that people
aren't really listening if they're working out what they're going to say
next by keeping the audience tasked on repeating the current
message.&nbsp;While someone with an electronic mic is addressing a passive
(and non-tasked) audience, they might disengage and begin
side-conversations if they find the speaker uninteresting, or challenge
the speaker for control of the sound-space by shouting or booing.&nbsp;A
tasked crowd is less able to do these things[1. Another possible factor
is that HMs are imperfect methods of&nbsp;amplification&nbsp;and so can't tolerate
as much other noise, and so people are obliged to be quieter to let it
work at all].&nbsp;This raises a question: as the form of the human mic
requires people to take part in other people's words, what do people do
when they disagree with the message?&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef01539361fc5a970b">Dan
Kervick</a>
gives a possible answer:</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;At least at the GA I attended, it seemed to be understood that
you&nbsp;<em>would</em>&nbsp;try to repeat even those words you disagreed with.
People were repeating words even as they were giving down twinkles
of disapproval. However, even while repeating the words, you might
not say them with much enthusiasm. Sometimes people would repeat the
words fully, but in a &quot;yada, yada, yada ...&quot; tone of voice. The
force and enthusiasm element of the repeated words seems itself to
be part of the consensus-building aspect of the assembly discourse.
The speaker's rhetorical direction is influenced in some directions
and away from others by the audible and continuous rising and
falling of the assembly's support, and by the twinkles. [...] one
guy got very vulgar and self-indulgent, and the repetition flagged
in energy and took on a tone of &quot;C'mon man, stop being an ass.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>This might not be universal but in this case rather than cancelling or
drowning out the original speaker, people who are part of the microphone
instead <em>modulated</em>&nbsp;the original voice to express their opinion- the
message and dissent to the message become one and the same thing. This
means it isn't content-neutral as a medium, but also that people calling
it &quot;the people's mic&quot; aren't being entirely silly, as there's an extent
to which the crowd can imbue&nbsp;a statement with their own feelings about
that statement (although it clearly can't apply past the people taking
part).</p>
<p>In addition to the decentering point made
above&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-human-mic-and-the-construction-of-discursive-space.html#comment-6a00d8341ef41d53ef0154373e0ae7970c">some</a>in
the comments at APPS make the point that this is a form of amplification
that's slower and so friendlier to those who might not otherwise want to
step up and speak, but at Occupy Patriarchy Lucinda Marshall argues that
the human mic <a class="reference external" href="http://occupypatriarchy.org/2011/11/16/empowering-the-feminist-voice-at-occupy-confronting-the-silencing-of-mic-check-and-other-misogynies-in-the-occupy-movement/">isn't&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;that
empowering</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Listening&nbsp;to people yell, “Mic Check!” at Occupy locations
throughout the country, it is hard not to observe that those with
the loudest voices are the ones who really get heard with this
system, and those voices usually are male baritones.&nbsp; Talking to
women here in Washington and also reading reports from elsewhere, it
is clear that many women find this system of having to yell at the
top of your lungs to be one that is an uncomfortable way to
communicate and participate.&nbsp; Some women report being harassed when
they speak, and even of mics being grabbed from them.</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't seem to be a&nbsp;universal&nbsp;experience but it's a problem that
should qualify descriptions of HM's democratic virtue - &nbsp;for all its
merits it is as heart a means of amplification and that leaves it
vulnerable&nbsp;to existing disparities in voice.&nbsp;Still, it's a method that
has potential to enhance the deliberativeness of public conversation and
open up and democratize (to some extent) the sound-space, and so is far
more than the simple yelling it might appear to be at first.</p>
<p>Given this understanding of what the HMs are supposed to do, it becomes
clear that some groups aren't really using them correctly. Case in
point, &nbsp;a&nbsp;group of protesters at Cambridge University used what they
claimed was a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.defendeducation.co.uk/go-home-david-an-epistle-to-david-willetts">people's
mic</a>&quot;
to <a class="reference external" href="http://badconscience.com/2011/11/22/selfish-and-deluded/#comments">shut-down a David Willetts
event</a>,
but if it was it's a much poorer conception of the mic than the one
emerging as their aim wasn't to conduct discussion but to close it down,
not opening up the sound-space but filling with white noise to make it
unusable.&nbsp;As the form of the human mic becomes better established it'll

					<p>“It's like when we used to let kings take over from their fathers:
that's the craziest rule that ever existed. If the king dies they let
his kid be the king - what are the odds that he's not going to be a
piece of shit? That's one of the weirdest things that we've ever done as
a race of people.” &nbsp;- Louis C.K.</p>
<p>I’ll confess I wasn’t that excited when it was announced they’re finally
getting round to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15489544">ending male primogeniture for the
monarchy</a>. While it’s good in
principle in the sense that it’s absurd and sexist to say that a
second-born son is going to be a better ruler than a first-born
daughter, it’s also a bit absurd to say the first-born is inherently
going to be better at the job than the second-born. After a bit more
thought though, I realised that if you look at it from the other
direction (who it keeps off the throne) it actually makes a lot of sense
as a method of reducing violent&nbsp;political&nbsp;conflict.</p>
<p>If we imagine a different situation where an out-going king chose one of
their children on the basis of temperament and competency, this would
for many years introduce uncertainty about who the next king would be.
Uncertainty raises the potential power of factions as they angle behind
various contenders which in turn increases the probability of violence.
By introducing criteria for a ‘good king’ it would also make it more
likely that outsiders would try to make a case that they
better&nbsp;fulfil&nbsp;the criteria than any of the heirs on offer, which again,
increases the likelihood of violence. Always sticking with the
first-born means you don't have to judge on any other criteria, and the
order of&nbsp;succession&nbsp;will change as few times as possible[1. To bring
this back to male primogeniture, because swapping heirs from a girl to a
boy increases the number of order changes, on the face of it it's a bad
thing - but if the fundamental concern is stability and there's a
substantial faction that would back a male heir over a female heir
anyway, there's nothing to be gained by a system
that&nbsp;legitimized&nbsp;another potential faction.].&nbsp;So looking at it this way
it isn’t about selecting the right ruler, it’s about establishing norms
that disqualify everyone else. Lots of people can raise an army but
almost no one is the first-born son of the king.</p>
<p>All this was going through my head about about the same time as I was
reading the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books, which was convenient because
Martin spends an a lot of time dwelling on the problems of succession.
While the series is often quite <a class="reference external" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/07/18/realpolitik_in_a_fantasy_world">politically
interesting</a>&nbsp;what
I hadn’t noticed straight-off is how methodical he is at taking apart
and examining the problem of what makes a monarch legitimate - each of
the various Kings that end up fighting over the Iron Throne in <em>Game of
Thrones</em> and <em>Clash of Kings</em> are operating on different principles of
legitimation. Because Robert and Ned have overthrown Aeron the norms
governing succession have broken down and the stage is set for people
who would ordinarily be disqualified to make a play for the throne.
Given Joffrey is illegitimate, Stannis’ claim as the younger brother of
ex-King Robert is fairly straight-forward but there is no way for Renly
to trace a claim that doesn’t involve going through Stannis first.
Instead Renly bases his claim on a charismatic populism, not that he is
the rightful heir but that he would be a better and more popular king
than everyone else is on offer. Elsewhere Robb Stark is effectively
making the case for a right of national self-determination for the
North, Joffrey’s claim is mostly already being on the throne (there’s a
lot to be said for institutional inertia) and when the Greyjoys start
making trouble, they claim their lands by right of conquest - something
that lurks in the background of everyone else’s claims is their ability
to enforce them (the throne they’re competing over is literally made of
swords after all).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all of these are incompatible (there’s no
particular reason why Renly’s populism needs to clash with Robb’s
national self-determination) but between them all they lack a common
denominator to settle the issue other than endless bloody war, that’s
exactly what happened. While saying primogeniture results in peace would
clearly be an overstatement, it definitely has its upside. It’s also
inherently unstable because of the original problem that, just as it
doesn’t have a mechanism for selecting the most fit king, it also
doesn’t have a method of weeding out unfit ones either - for each
generation debilitating mental illness is a roll of the dice, as is the
possibility that the new monarch might just be such an awful person that
they threaten the system. It’s not wonderful, but part of what makes
Westeros such a depressing place is that sometimes it might just be as
good as you're going to get.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trainorphans/291910257/"><img alt="ballot" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/112/291910257_043c2e8f2e_m.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-plan-to-take-charge-of-scottish-independence-vote-6260514.html">interesting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the other issues which Mr Mundell has been exploring is
whether the Coalition Government might be able to amend the current
laws to force the Scottish Government to ask a clear Yes/No question
on independence.</p>
<p>Mr Salmond has made it clear he favours a three-option referendum
with the Scottish people being asked to back full independence, the
status quo or &quot;independence lite&quot; – a settlement which many
unionists believe would leave Scotland independent in all but name.</p>
<p>There have also been suggestions from the Nationalists that Scots
would be able to choose more than one option in the referendum –
prompting critics to warn that the SNP could secure independence
even if this was only the second-best supported option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Kellner of YouGov has a <a class="reference external" href="http://labs.yougov.co.uk/news/2012/01/16/scotland-and-kellner-conundrum/">good run
down</a>
of all the possible ways of asking this question apart from
two-questions. Although the SNP seems to be backing down from a
two-question route <a class="reference external" href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2012/0126/1224310756011.html">they're leaving a space open for it to
return</a>,
and ERS Scotland<a class="reference external" href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/press-releases">is advocating a different
form</a> of the
two-question format, making it worthwhile having a look at exactly what
the problems are with it.</p>
<p>One possible set of questions (Set 1) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Do you prefer independence to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Do you prefer devo-max to the status quo?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question choice could lead to the situation where both independence
and devo-max receive majorities (or even, for the purposes of argument,
super-majorities) but devo-max receives a larger majority than
independence - what then does the referendum say should be done
about&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;independence?</p>
<p>One answer would be that the&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;government would at that point be
well within its rights to declare independence, a majority has declared
its support. &nbsp;The other way to argue it is that when there are two
possible consensuses on offer, a&nbsp;democracy should seek to create the
largest possible consensus - which in this case is devo-max and it'd be
wrong to leave the union when a strong majority is in support of it. As
a convincing case could be made either way Set 1 creates the possibility
of an ambiguous result, which is bad.</p>
<p>There is something seemingly nonsensical about the idea&nbsp;a majority can
be in favour of both the union and independence which gives us a clue as
to where Set 1 went wrong. The problem is that although it seems like we
do, we don't actually have&nbsp;information&nbsp;on if people would
prefer&nbsp;independence&nbsp;to devo-max or vica versa. If 'status quo' is A,
'independence' is B and 'devo-max' is C, we have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that B and
C are superior to A (to differing degrees), but we can't from this
deduce people's ordering of B and C. If you replaced all voters who
preferred C to B to A with voters who preferred B to C to A the
questions in Set 1 would still return exactly the same result.&nbsp;Given in
the situation above we're trying to work out which winning claim is
superior, that all the people who actually have opinions on this can
change their mind without affecting the result is a problem.</p>
<p>If the SNP want to use this question they're really shooting themselves
in the foot. It's highly likely that if independence can win a majority
then devo-max will be able to win a higher majority and so make any
resulting move towards independence appear illegitimate - which it may
or not be because we have no way of knowing which of B or C voters
prefer.&nbsp;One alternative set of questions (Set 2) would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: Would you like a change to the status quo?</p>
<p>2: Would you prefer&nbsp;independence or devo-max?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This set was pretty much the format used for the 1997 Scottish
referendum and one of the possibilities that was occasionally floated
for an electoral system referendum. Willie Sulivan at ERS Scotland
argues that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If there is only to be one question then the structure is
straightforward; a simple Yes or No for Independence.</p>
<p>“If the consultation responses indicate that the Scottish people
want the opportunity to vote on all three options, then the best way
to do this would be to ask two questions on the same ballot paper:
The first asking yes or no to any change and the second to determine
what level of change. This approach was recently road-tested in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>“This is by far the simplest and fairest way to ensure that everyone
gets a real say but we are concerned that instead of ensuring that
it’s the Scottish people who have a chance to determine Scotland’s
future, the debate among politicians is becoming polarised and
disingenuous.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I think especially in the context of this referendum, this question
set can end up treating a particular group of voters unfairly - while at
first glance this seems to solve the problem above by giving a clear
choice between B and C, but it doesn't allow people to place A(status
quo) as a middle preference. Say we get a majority in favour of change
in question 1 and a majority in favour of independence in question 2, we
have&nbsp;information&nbsp;that a majority prefer B or C to A, and that a majority
prefer B to C.&nbsp;The problem is that the ballot design assumes A is either
a voter's first or last preference.&nbsp;If question 1 could be swung by a
single vote but question 2 already had a majority for independence,
a&nbsp;voter who wanted devo-max, but doesn't want independence (and so has
the status quo as their second choice) will vote yes on question 1 -
giving independence victory despite the fact that that was not their
intention.</p>
<p>From these we can see that it's very hard to get people to choose
between more than two options using two yes/no questions and that there
are grounds for restrictions on the kind of questions and not just the
wording that should be asked in referendum (although this should
probably be done by the Electoral Commission rather than
a&nbsp;political&nbsp;stitch-up in&nbsp;Westminster).&nbsp;This leaves either&nbsp;a single
yes/no question on a single issue, adding another yes/no question to
make it a Condorcet vote as Kellner recommends, or&nbsp;preferential voting
among multiple options using AV - of which the last for me seems
the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;method of better way of determining what people actually
want.&nbsp;Obviously this was a non-starter in an AV referendum as conceding
that voters are capable of dealing with multiple preferences would have
been giving the game away, but many&nbsp;Scottish&nbsp;voters already use
preferential voting with STV in local elections so there's no real
reason why it couldn't be used - 'simpler' formats really aren't
simpler.</p>

					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/Johannhari-150x150.jpg" />The Independent has finished it's investigation into the
Johann Hari saga and while&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html">Hari has
apologised</a>,
it's in such a way that reinforces the idea I've seen in a few places
that at least partly due to Hari being plucked right out of the
university and missing some of the fine points of the journalistic code
on his way to the top:</p>
<blockquote>
I am going to take an unpaid leave of absence from The Independent
until 2012, and at my own expense I will be undertaking a programme
of journalism training.<strong>(I rose very fast in journalism straight
from university</strong>.) And third, when I return, I will footnote all my
articles online and post the audio online of any on-the-record
conversations so that everyone can hear them and verify they were
said directly to me.</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt that's probably true and that Hari (like almost everyone)
would have benefited from more on-the-job training, but&nbsp;a&nbsp;big part of
being an undergraduate is learning and internalizing academic codes of
behaviour about how you use other people's work, words and ideas in your
own. This viewpoint&nbsp;seems to suggest that &quot;it is a bad thing to pass off
other people's work as your own&quot; is an obscure bit of the journalism
rules rather than, as someone with a double-first from Cambridge,
something he should have been a little bit&nbsp;acquainted - as <a class="reference external" href="http://jeremyduns.blogspot.com/2011/09/johann-haris-apology-some-thoughts.html">Jeremy Duns
points
out</a>,
the word I've hardly seen at all in this is 'plagiarism'. Similarly that
harassing&nbsp;and defaming people is bad isn't an obscure point, but
something you're supposed to learn at an even earlier level of
schooling. &nbsp;Hari doesn't have a journalism problem as much as an ethics
problem and, while that's not irreconcilable with a return to
journalism, it is a serious problem for a future as the moral campaigner
he so clearly sees himself as.</p>

					<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx"><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/binladen-300x247.png" /></a>A colouring book setting out to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coloringbook.com/weshallneverforget911coloringbook.aspx">explain 9/11 to
kids</a>
is obviously walking a mine field of every variety, but looking at the
site what I found most bizarre was the media excerpt section - Take this
quote from the New Yorker:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after
September 11, 2001, and this presents parents with a dilemma: How do
you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief.</blockquote>
<p>Which might be taking small liberties with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2011/09/911-coloring-book.html">original
intent</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Most of the children in elementary schools today were born after

you explain the event to a child who has no first-hand knowledge of
it? As the ten-year anniversary approaches, parents worrying about
how to handle the subject can breathe a sigh of relief. Skip the
complexity and just hand them a new coloring book, “We Shall Never
Forget 9/11: The Kids’ Book of Freedom,” that explains all—and, to
cite just one example of the tastelessness (as seen above), gives
kids the opportunity to color in a member of SEAL Team Six taking
aim at a veiled woman and, cowering just behind her, Osama bin Laden
himself.</blockquote>
<p>Now clipping down negative reviews to positive sentences has a long and
proud tradition but the excerpt&nbsp;from the Chicago Tribune is even
stranger:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bell said the book is mild compared with the graphic video games
children play or even footage of the attacks that shows people
plunging from the World Trade Center towers.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;It's a generic black-and-white coloring book with tender
language for the children and their parents,&quot; Bell said. &quot;It's
designed as a teaching and learning tool, and it's a memorial
tribute to the families of 9/11.&quot;</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The eagle-eyed will note that quote is entirely made up of an interview
with Bell himself.</p>
