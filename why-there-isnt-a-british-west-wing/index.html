					<p><img alt="image0" src="/uploads/west-wing.jpg" />I've just finished Andrew Rawnsley's&nbsp;<em>`The End of the
Party &lt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/End-Party-Andrew-Rawnsley/dp/0670918512&gt;`__</em>&nbsp;and
in the period when Brown thought a Lib-Lab coalition was a possibility
there's this brief anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
'He felt his legacy could be a progressive coalition. Brown imagined
a final six months at Number 10 as the sort of benign, presidential
'father of the nation' figure he had often dreamed of being. Talking
to Tom Fletcher that evening, Brown said: &quot;If we somehow pull this
off, you'll find I'll turn into President Bartlet.'&quot;</blockquote>
<p>That Brown with his long-standing affinity for America would reach for
<em>The West Wing</em>&nbsp;as a model for a national leader perhaps isn't that
surprising but the infulence of the show is a recurring presence in
British politics,&nbsp;from rumours that George Osbourne was basing a No. 10
floor plan around the West Wing to a'West Wing plot' &nbsp;leading to a
government defeat and, more recently,&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jul/12/edmiliband-davidcameron">Ed Miliband's
advisors</a>&nbsp;ending
meetings declaring '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9-3NxTzQ8">Let Bartlet be
Bartlet</a>'. Biblical
allusions might now past us by, but&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqgLr5A0-m0">everyone knows who Josh
is</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://tomcharris.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/a-british-west-wing-beyond-our-abilities/">Tom
Harris</a>
takes the lack of a British West Wing with an optimistic and positive
portrayal of&nbsp;politicians partly as a failure of the &nbsp;nation's&nbsp;appetite
(which he sees as being incapable of digesting a show that earnest if
the accents were closer to home), but also the&nbsp;nation's writers - unable
to write politicians&nbsp;as anything other than cynical or corrupt. I think
this oversells the case, British television may not have produced the
West Wing but American television only&nbsp;barely&nbsp;did, producing it just
once and common portrayals of&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;in the US often skew closer to
the cynical. Not to say there's nothing to the idea of national tastes
but I think that there are specific structural problems with crafting&nbsp;a
positive show about the machinery of government that make it easier
to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;in the US than the UK. A clue as to why is&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://wrongquestions.blogspot.com/2006/12/once-and-future-president.html">Abigail
Nussbaum's
take</a>&nbsp;that
the West Wing is essentially a show&nbsp;about the royal court of a more
politically acceptable medieval monarchy. Interestingly she points out
one of the most obvious example of this interpretation is from the same
episode that Miliband's advisors are drawing from, &quot;Let Bartlet be
Bartlet&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
Leo turns to each of the staff as they recite &quot;I serve at the
pleasure of &nbsp;the President of the United States.&quot; He isn't leading a
pep rally; he's reminding them of their oaths of fealty, and
reminding Bartlet, who is standing just outside the room, of the
courage and devotion of the men and women he commands.</blockquote>
<p>Put in this context it's quite clear why something with the tone of the
West Wing would be quite hard to achieve in the UK - while the US
political system sanitised the trappings of monarchy, the UK instead
moved power into different arenas. The characters in the West Wing are
all attempting to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;the agenda of one man while also trying to
shape that agenda - the show's universe revolves around the President
and his staff's loyalty to him. &nbsp;While the British Prime Minister is
potentially more powerful, they are not the only one in the room who
matters, their power base &nbsp;is only one among many. In the Parliamentary
system many of the key positions of government are staffed by MPs&nbsp;with
their own electoral mandate and their own overlapping and shared (but
also unique) agendas. Prime Ministers live with the constant knowledge
that the party as much as the electorate will be the eventual decider of
their fate. If a British Bartlet had concealed their MS, their decision
to seek a second term would be likely to be far less of a personal
decision.</p>
<p>Conflict is the bread and butter of drama and while the
check-and-balance heavy US system is filled with potential external
opponents for the team (it's not a coincidence that there's a Republican
Congress for the entire run) meaning that while there are conflicts
within the team, they remain low key and amicable. For a UK government
with a majority there are few effectual external opponents - the primary
antagonisms are then within the party, within the government and within
the main cast.&nbsp;The West Wing transplanted to the New Labour era would
have the PM with the ability to do pretty much anything he wanted,
unless it was blocked by the second-billed character, a long-term friend
turned antagonist. Bartlet's troubled relationship with his Vice
President is ultimately harmless because the Vice Presidency isn't
necessarily&nbsp;powerful (it's not a surprise that Iannucci's US version
of&nbsp;<em>The Thick Of It</em>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a314997/armando-iannuccis-veep-picked-up-by-hbo.html">is based around the
VP</a>),
the nearest analogy would be if Bartlet and Leo were at each other's
throats - it would be very hard for for the West Wing to be an
optimistic show in this context.</p>
<p>Because the institution of the Prime Minster is relatively flexible,
depending on the circumstances of their election and the style of the
leader (the Major era very different from Blair, very different to
Cameron, etc)&nbsp;there's no&nbsp;equivalent&nbsp;to the status of the Presidency
(except, of course, the Monarchy). The positive feelings and
glorification of the&nbsp;institution's&nbsp;history as well as the status-quo
bias of the US policy process justifies a kind of mythic stasis - &nbsp;big
projects of the staff like Sam's&nbsp;Manhattan&nbsp;project for beating cancer,
Josh and Toby's tax-deductible&nbsp;tuition are ultimately stories&nbsp;about&nbsp;why
these things didn't happen.&nbsp;There are battles, some of which are won and
some of which aren't, but the status quo of the West Wing mostly remains
the same - there have always been kings and knights on horses defending
the realm and there always will be, they will be fighting about gun
control, gay rights, religion in government, today and tomorrow, and
tomorrow and tomorrow. That the characters take sides in this eternal
conflict without scoring any lasting&nbsp;successes&nbsp;(this only really applies
to the Sorkin era, once he leaves they quickly bring peace to the Middle
East) is arguably realistic in the context of a&nbsp;political&nbsp;system where
paralysis is envisioned as a positive feature and so even failure can
glorify the system. The ability of a British government to achieve
change (and the expectation that they will which stigmatizes&nbsp;failure)
combined with a lack of a long-term, static institution of the Prime
Minister would make it difficult for a British West Wing to find the
same amicable atmosphere where characters sit around and talk about
timeless&nbsp;issues in a consequence-free way.</p>
<p>While none of this completely rules out the possibility of a optimistic
and earnest show about British politics (I've been trying to get hold of
the 'Number 10' Radio 4 plays to see if they pull it off), it does make
it easier to understand why&nbsp;The West Wing has only happened once in the
US and not at all in the UK.&nbsp;The 'royal court' take on the West Wing
would actually suggest we've had several films in the previous decade
that had optimistic and positive portrayals of the British system, they
were just all about the monarchy.</p>
